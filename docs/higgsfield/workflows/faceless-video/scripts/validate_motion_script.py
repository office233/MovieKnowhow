# Word budget per 10s block. The narration skill writes to these numbers, so the
# gate has to agree with it or every passing line fails validation.
#
# RE-MEASURED 2026-08-04 FOR THE NEW ENGINE. Narration moved from `seed_audio` to
# `text2speech_v2` variant `elevenlabs`, and the numbers below are the Eleven measurement.
# Ten takes on the pinned Cillian voice, same line, word count varied:
#
#   words   speech                    spread   inside the THEN-current 8.0-9.5
#   28      10.58 11.65 11.33 11.20    1.07s   0 of 4 — every take LONGER than the block
#   22       9.14  9.30  9.07          0.23s   3 of 3
#   20       8.08  7.82  8.39          0.57s   2 of 3, one under the old 8.0 floor
#
# Two things Eleven does differently and both matter:
# 1. IT IGNORES THE TIMECODE BRACKET. With `[00:00-00:09]` the takes ran 10.58 and 11.65;
#    without it, 11.33 and 11.20 — overlapping ranges, no shortening. The bracket is not
#    read aloud (verified by transcription) but it does not pace either, so the whole
#    length-control mechanism the seed numbers relied on is gone. `text2speech_v2` also
#    exposes NO rate parameter: variant, voice_type, voice_id and nothing else.
# 2. SHORTER LINES ARE STEADIER. At 28 words the spread between two takes of one line was
#    1.07s; at 22 words it was 0.23s. Under seed_audio the spread was 0.01s, so Eleven is
#    an order of magnitude looser and the band has to carry that.
#
# Hence the band comes down again and the floor comes down with it: at ~2.40 words/second
# a 20-word line can land at 7.82 and a 23-word one near 9.5, so the window is 7.8-9.5 and
# the band 20-23. Holding the old 8.0 floor would have left 21-22 words — two integers,
# which is not a band anyone can write to.
# Pass --words-min/--words-max to set the band outright.
#
# The seed_audio measurement from 2026-08-03, kept because the song mode and the
# picture-story continuous read still run on that engine:
#
#   bracket   words   speech      last 20ms      verdict
#   00:09     28      8.87 8.86   -25.8 -44.6    one take of two CUT MID-WORD
#   00:10     28      9.80 9.53   -43.7 -74.7    intact, both ABOVE the 9.5 ceiling
#   00:10     23      9.65 9.46   -65.4 -75.5    intact, one above the ceiling
#   00:09     23      8.68 8.48   -74.1 -55.8    intact, both inside the window
#
# The finding that matters: THE BRACKET SETS THE DURATION, THE WORD COUNT SETS THE PACE.
# 23 words on a 00:10 bracket ran LONGER (9.65s) than 28 words on the same bracket
# (9.53s) — the voice simply slowed from 2.9 to 2.4 words/second to fill the time it was
# given. So a words-per-second constant does not describe the voice, it describes
# whatever ratio the last line happened to use, and a band derived from one is arithmetic
# on top of an artefact. The 3.32 wps measured on 2026-08-01 was not a property of the
# voice; it was 28 words divided by a 9-second bracket.
#
# Which is why the band comes DOWN rather than the bracket going up. At 28 words the
# read needs the whole 9s and lands flush against its own fence with no room to release
# the closing consonant, and half the takes lose the last word — the defect reported on
# dev with the word "minute" missing from the audio while it sat in the captions. At 23
# words the same bracket leaves 0.3-0.5s of decay and every take survives.
DEFAULT_WORD_BUDGET = (20, 23)
# Initial scripts still use the calibrated house band above. Only a block whose take was
# measured above the hard speech ceiling may use this lower floor on a duration retry.
# ElevenLabs produced several clean 20-word takes at 10.1-10.7s on DEV; keeping 20 as a
# hard floor made the only permitted correction (shorter wording) impossible.

# Seconds of speech inside a 10s block — the assembler's own band, and it must stay
# equal to it. MOVED 2026-08-01 from 8.6-9.6 to where the provider actually lands.
# Six consecutive takes at the [00:00-00:09] bracket measured 8.58 8.61 8.65 8.69 8.94
# 8.98: the old floor of 8.6 ran through the middle of that distribution, so good takes
# were rejected by tens of milliseconds, while the old ceiling of 9.6 left the closing
# word 0.05s from the -t CLIP cut and shaved letters off the takes that did reach it.
# Both failures were the band sitting in the wrong place, not the takes being wrong.
# FLOOR MOVED 2026-08-04 from 8.0 to 7.8 with the engine swap. Eleven has no rate control
# and no bracket to pace against, so the only lever left is the word count, and at ~2.40
# words/second a 20-word line can land at 7.82. Holding 8.0 would have squeezed the band to
# 21-22 words. The 200ms is inaudible; a band nobody can write to is not.

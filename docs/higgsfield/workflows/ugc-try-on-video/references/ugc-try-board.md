# UGC storyboard prompt — full rule set

This file is the complete rule set for the storyboard-sheet prompt. There is no enhancer service
here: you read these rules, write ONE prompt string yourself, and submit it.

```json
generate_image({ "params": {
  "model": "gpt_image_2",
  "prompt": "<the string you wrote>",
  "aspect_ratio": "21:9",
  "resolution": "2k",
  "quality": "high",
  "medias": [
    { "value": "<product_media_id>", "role": "image" },
    { "value": "<character_media_id>", "role": "image" },
    { "value": "<previous_board_media_id>", "role": "image" }
  ]
}})
```

The `medias` order MUST match the `@Image1 / @Image2 / @Image3` table below — the declarations you
write into the prompt are what bind them. Drop the entries that do not apply (no product, K == 1)
and shift the numbering with them. Poll `job_status`, then run the MANDATORY Seedream de-slop pass
from SKILL.md; the de-slopped output replaces this board downstream.

You are a UGC try-on storyboard prompt enhancer. You work from structured inputs describing one board of a UGC try-on video — its arc role, position in the sequence, clip duration, product context (the clothing item / accessory being worn), character reference, and (optionally) the previous board for continuity. You output ONE production-ready prompt string for the `gpt_image_2` image model that produces a photorealistic UGC try-on storyboard sheet: exactly EIGHT equal-size 9:16 vertical slots arranged in ONE HORIZONTAL ROW, total sheet aspect 21:9. Do NOT make two rows and do NOT make a grid — exactly eight panels in one row, never ten, never twelve.

Write the prompt as a plain string; there is no JSON wrapper and no enhancer service in
this pipeline.

---

## Sheet geometry on this connector

`gpt_image_2` accepts `21:9` through the canonical FNF model contract. Generate the sheet at
**21:9** so all eight equal vertical compositions fit the supported ultra-wide canvas in one row.

## Inputs to settle before writing

Settle these yourself from the brief, the product analysis, and the run state — nothing is
handed to you:

```
{
  "K": <integer — this board's index, 1-based>,
  "N": <integer — total boards in the video>,
  "arc_role": "BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL" | "BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR" | "BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR" | "BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT" | "BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP",
  "clip_duration": <integer 4-15 — seconds of the Seedance clip this board feeds>,
  "tier": "luxury" | "premium" | "drugstore",
  "input_tier": "auto" | "guided" | "director",
  "user_request": "<original brief verbatim — used to read user-specified overrides and tone keywords>",
  "product_description": "<string from product-analyzer, or null when no product>",
  "character_media_id": "<reference media id — character image is always provided>",
  "product_media_id": "<reference media id, or null>",
  "previous_board_media_id": "<reference media id of board K-1, or null when K==1>"
}
```

## Output

The prompt string itself — plain text, no JSON wrapper, no fences, no commentary. Pass it as
`params.prompt` of the `generate_image` call at the top of this file (`gpt_image_2`, `21:9`, `2k`,
`quality: high`) with the reference `medias` in `@ImageN` order.

## CORE PRINCIPLE

The sheet is a sequential UGC try-on storyboard for ONE Seedance clip of `clip_duration` seconds — eight frames showing eight narrative beats inside that single clip. NOT a presentation deck. No headers, no metadata blocks, no pop-text captions, no badges, no numbers, no brand-matched design system, no typography of any kind. Just eight equal-size 9:16 slots in one row, each containing a photorealistic UGC iPhone-style still that advances a coherent try-on story. Slots are separated by thin white gutters. **All eight slots are always active — there are no placeholder slots.** **For Board 1 (`arc_role == "BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL"`) the eight slots follow a fixed try-on arc: PRE_WEAR → WEARING → FRONT_POSE → TEXTURE_CLOSEUP → TURN → DETAIL → STYLE_POSE → FINAL_LOOK.** Subsequent boards carry their own K-specific arc (`BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR` / `BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR` / `BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT` / `BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP` for K≥5) — see Step 3 (location progression) and Step 4 (per-K arc table).

The character is supplied via reference image — never generate or describe their face, body, age, or appearance. Reference them only as "the same person from the character reference image, with identical face, hair, body, and identity across all eight slots."

The product (when supplied) is the **clothing item / accessory being worn** and follows strict Garment Consistency Lock, Realistic Fit, and Outfit Continuity rules.

Story matters. Setting matters. Camera POV adapts to the action in each slot and **may change between slots — every POV change aligns with a hard cut between slots, never a smooth transition.** Hand count is enforced.

---

## Image Reference Order (mandatory in prompt)

Based on which reference media_ids you receive, your output prompt MUST start with explicit `@Image1` / `@Image2` / `@Image3` references in this order:

| References present | `@Image1` | `@Image2` | `@Image3` |
|---|---|---|---|
| product + character + previous_board (K>1) | product | character | previous board |
| product + character (K==1) | product | character | — |
| character + previous_board (no product) | character | previous board | — |
| character only | character | — | — |

The prompt MUST start with explicit `@ImageN` declarations in this order.

---

## Input Tiers (passed via `input_tier`)

| `input_tier` | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | Full autopilot — build a default UGC try-on mini-arc for the assigned `arc_role`. |
| `guided` | Preserve the brief's tone / emphasis / mood. Build the slot structure yourself. |
| `director` | Map the user's beats 1:1 onto the 8 slots in their order. Adapt only physically unsafe interactions. The Outfit Continuity rule, Kraft Bag S1-only rule, and Mirror Ban remain non-negotiable even under director input. |

---

## User Override Rule

If `user_request` specifies any concrete detail — setting, location, clothing, action, mood, time of day, props, slot order, story beats — that detail takes priority over every default below. Exception: the canonical PRE_WEAR → WEARING → TEXTURE_CLOSEUP → STYLE_POSE arc for Board 1, the Outfit Continuity rule, the Kraft Bag S1-only rule, and the Mirror Ban are non-negotiable unless `input_tier == "director"` explicitly overrides the arc order (the Outfit Continuity / Kraft Bag / Mirror Ban remain locked even for director).

---

## Step 1 — Product Understanding (Clothing-Specific)

### Mode A: `product_description` is provided (default when product is present)

Use the description directly. Extract: product name, brand, category (top / dress / outerwear / pants / skirt / accessory / shoes / handbag / jewelry / hat), fabric type, primary color, secondary color or print, silhouette (slim / oversized / cropped / midi / maxi / fitted / drape / boxy / structured), recognizable design details (collar style, neckline, hem, sleeve length, hardware, buttons, zippers, prints, stitching).

If the description does not explicitly cover physical attributes you need (fabric, silhouette, drape, fit class), supplement by visually analyzing the `@Image1` product reference:

1. Garment category — top / blouse / shirt / dress / skirt / pants / shorts / jacket / coat / outerwear / shoes / handbag / jewelry / hat / accessory
2. Fabric vibe — woven / knit / leather / denim / silk / linen / cotton / synthetic / sequined / sheer
3. Silhouette — slim / oversized / cropped / midi / maxi / fitted / drape / boxy / structured
4. Primary color + secondary color or print
5. Key design details — neckline / collar style / sleeve length / hem / hardware (buttons, zippers, buckles) / unique features (cutouts, ruching, pleats)
6. Real-world fit — how it would actually drape on the body (informs S2 full-body framing decisions)
7. Forbidden actions — anything that deforms the garment, stretches it violently, or invents unseen design details
8. Absent-by-design features — if the product sells on an ABSENCE (seamless, strapless, no closures, no zipper, no pockets), the image model hallucinates the default affordance back in. State the absence in BOTH places: the prompt body ("seamless bodice — one smooth panel, no visible seams") AND the closing negative run ("no zipper, no buttons, no visible seams")
9. Closure / hardware anatomy — name what closes the garment and WHERE, once, in plain positional terms ("front-center zip", "buttons on the left placket", "side-tie at the right waist"), and reuse that exact phrasing in every board of the video. Vague hardware renders impossible geometry (a zip that migrates sides between slots)

### Mode D: No product (`product_media_id == null` AND `product_description == null`)

Try-on without a product reference is degenerate. The character carries the entire arc through the canonical eight beats — Slot 2 describes a stand-in "new outfit" in words; Slots 4 and 6 frame generic fabric/cut details. No `@Image` product references. No Garment Consistency Lock.

---

## Step 2 — Character Reference Rules

The character is always supplied via input image and must NEVER be re-described.

In every prompt, include:

`@Image[N] is the character reference. The same person appears in every slot with identical face, hair, body, and identity. Do not alter facial features, hairstyle, body proportions, or skin tone between slots.`

**Outfit Continuity (mandatory — CORE OF THE TRY-ON ARC):**
- **Board 1, Slot 1 (PRE_WEAR)**: character wears a boring/neutral home base outfit — pick a gender-neutral default (`basic tee + lounge pants` / `oversized hoodie + cotton shorts` / `plain knit pullover + sweatpants` / `simple cotton robe in neutral tone`). Visually muted, never competing with the product, no bold prints, no statement pieces.
- **Board 1, Slot 2 onward + all slots of Boards 2..N**: character wears the **product** as the outfit. The pre-wear outfit is GONE forever after Board 1 / Slot 1 — never re-introduce it.
- **Hairstyle stays consistent across all slots and boards** — the character does not change hair between slots.

When a previous-board reference is present (K > 1), wardrobe/hairstyle defaults to matching the previous board's product outfit exactly.

Never describe the character's age, ethnicity, attractiveness, makeup, or features beyond what the reference image already supplies.

---

## Step 3 — Setting and Lighting Logic

Default: inherit setting and lighting from the character reference image, biased to the home-aesthetic implied by `tier`:
- `luxury` → clean lines, marble / oak / linen / soft directional daylight, minimal high-end furniture, styled corner, plants in matte planters
- `premium` → stylish lived-in apartment, modern textures, plants, soft directional daylight, lived-in but tasteful
- `drugstore` → cozy / casual home, sofa, hallway, kitchen, soft warm tones, relaxed

Reference in the prompt:

`Setting and lighting in slots 1-6 default to the same home environment, time of day, and light direction visible in the character reference image, with a tier-matched aesthetic. Slots 7-8 are in a different room of the same home (matched aesthetic). Hairstyle identical across all slots.`

Per-K location progression (mandatory):

- **K==1 (`BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL`):** Slots 1-6 share the primary home location inherited from the character reference image. Slots 7-8 are in a DIFFERENT room of the same home, tier-matched. This is the canonical try-on arc — see Step 4.
- **K==2 (`BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR`):** Slot 1 is a logical continuation of the prior board's final location (same or adjacent room, same light direction — the viewer should feel the video continues from where the previous board ended). Slots 2-8 move through DIFFERENT rooms of the same home (kitchen / hallway / bedroom / balcony / living room — any room not yet shown), tier-matched.
- **K==3 (`BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR`):** All 8 slots are OUTDOOR, tier-matched (luxury → upscale street / café terrace / promenade / park; premium → modern urban walk / stylish café / plaza; drugstore → neighborhood walk / suburban street / local café). Slot 1 is dry outdoor establishing. Light rain appears from Slot 2 and persists through the wet-droplet macros (slots 4 and 6). Slots 7-8 may be post-rain styled pose OR sheltered styled pose (under awning / café terrace covered seating / doorway). Hair stays dry across all slots — see Step 7d.
- **K==4 (`BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT`):** Back INSIDE the home — all 8 slots indoor in 1-2 tier-matched rooms (may be primary, may be a new room not yet shown). Character is settled into a comfortable spot (sofa / armchair / window-seat / bed / kitchen island). Slot 1 may be SELFIE talking-head — see Step 7e.
- **K≥5 (`BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP`):** Loop pattern. Alternate between home tour (any previously shown or new tier-matched room) and outdoor (tier-matched street / park / café). Character in product outfit throughout. All rules from the matching K=1..4 location type continue applying.

When K > 1 and a previous-board reference is provided: character identity / outfit / hairstyle MUST stay locked to the previous board. Lighting time-of-day matches. Location follows the K-specific progression above — never randomly switches to an inconsistent setting.

Lighting fallback: soft neutral daylight from a clear directional source (left or right window) for indoor; overcast / cool neutral midday daylight for outdoor. **Never golden hour, warm sunset, orange/amber cast, late-afternoon warm wash** unless `user_request` explicitly asks. Never harsh studio strobes.

---

## Step 4 — Canonical Try-On Arc Across the 8 Slots

Every try-on Board 1 (`arc_role == "BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL"`) carries the canonical 8-slot arc. Slots 1-8 ALWAYS represent these eight beats — never deviate, never reorder.

| Slot | Role | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PRE_WEAR | Character in a boring/neutral home base outfit (basic tee + lounge pants / oversized hoodie + cotton shorts / plain knit + sweatpants / simple robe — gender-neutral default, visually muted). A single **kraft paper shopping bag** (plain brown craft paper, no logo, no branding, optional handles tinted to match the product's primary color) is in the frame — held by one handle at the character's side OR placed upright on a surface beside the character. Product is NOT visible (still inside the bag). Expression: genuine anticipation on the bag — eyes bright, grin breaking (register per Step 10; the explosive-hype version ONLY on explicit hype signals). |
| 2 | WEARING | Character now wearing the **product** as the outfit, full-body or three-quarter framing, locked-off static camera. Pre-wear outfit is gone (implicit costume change handled by the hard cut between Slot 1 and Slot 2). The kraft bag is GONE from frame. Product is the focus. Expression: the board's genuine peak reaction on the new look — a real jaw-drop breaking into a wide warm grin, eyes lit, mouth open mid-word / mid-sentence as she lip-syncs the Cut 2 audio in the downstream video, full-body delight at human scale (register per Step 10; the blown-wide hyped version ONLY on explicit hype signals). |
| 3 | FRONT_POSE | Character front-facing in the product, full-body or three-quarter framing at a DIFFERENT distance/POV from Slot 2, showing the complete fit head to toe — an alive stance (weight on one hip, a small rotation, one hand smoothing the front or resting) that reads the silhouette. Lip-sync slot (mouth open mid-word as she lip-syncs the Cut 3 audio). Kraft bag GONE. |
| 4 | TEXTURE_CLOSEUP | Tight close-up showing the product's fabric / cut / texture detail through framing, drape, and light only. **NO hand contact with the fabric** — the macro is hand-free. Character partially visible (partial face / torso); hands stay at sides / off-frame / clearly NOT touching the garment. Voiceover slot — character silent on camera. Expression: engaged admiration — lips parted, eyes locked on the detail, a quiet "oh this is good" focus (the awed "ooooh" hyped-admiration version ONLY on explicit hype signals — register per Step 10). |
| 5 | TURN | Character turned to show the SIDE or BACK of the garment (mid-turn, or back-to-camera glancing over the shoulder) — reveals the cut / drape from a new angle, an alive body already in the turn. Lip-sync slot (mouth open mid-word as she lip-syncs the Cut 5 audio). Kraft bag GONE. |
| 6 | DETAIL | A SECOND hand-free macro on a DIFFERENT garment detail than Slot 4 (hem / sleeve / collar / hardware / print / seam) — framing tight, **NO hand contact**, reading through drape and light. Voiceover slot — character silent on camera. |
| 7 | STYLE_POSE | Character in a **different room of the same home** (tier-matched), styled in a confident pose (seated in accent armchair / window-seat with soft daylight / leaning against doorframe / mid-step walking confidently / on kitchen island / on stairs / on balcony — pick ONE per board). Outfit-complete details: shoes visible if full-body framing; up to 1 paired accessory optional. Expression: confident victory wrap — warm open grin or a small delighted laugh, mouth open mid-word as she lip-syncs the Cut 7 audio in the downstream video, body radiating genuine "I look incredible" confidence (the massive-grin explosive version ONLY on explicit hype signals — register per Step 10). The kraft bag is GONE. |
| 8 | FINAL_LOOK | A settled, alive final wrap in the STYLE_POSE room (or a natural continuation of it) — a last confident look to the lens, a warm open grin or small delighted laugh, loop-ready mid-motion. Lip-sync slot (mouth open mid-word as she lip-syncs the Cut 8 audio). Kraft bag GONE. |

For K > 1, the canonical Board 1 arc above does NOT apply — each subsequent board carries its own K-specific arc per the table below. Across all K, the kraft bag never returns after Board 1 Slot 1, the pre-wear outfit never returns after Board 1 Slot 1, character identity / hairstyle / product outfit stay locked, and each board is conditioned on the previous board's final slot via `previous_board_media_id`.

| K | arc_role | 8-beat flow (slot 1 → slot 8) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL` | PRE_WEAR → WEARING → FRONT_POSE → TEXTURE_CLOSEUP → TURN → DETAIL → STYLE_POSE (different room) → FINAL_LOOK |
| 2 | `BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR` | BRIDGE_FROM_PREV (continue prior board's final room / vibe) → NEW_ROOM_POSE_A → NEW_ROOM_POSE_B → garment-detail hand-free macro (voiceover) → NEW_ROOM_POSE_C → second hand-free detail macro (voiceover) → NEW_ROOM_STYLED_WRAP → FINAL_LOOK |
| 3 | `BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR` | OUTDOOR_ESTABLISH (dry) → OUTDOOR_IN_RAIN (light rain begins, droplets on fabric) → OUTDOOR_WALK_POSE → FABRIC_WATER_MACRO (hand-free, voiceover) → OUTDOOR_TURN → second wet-detail hand-free macro (voiceover) → OUTDOOR_STYLED_WRAP (post-rain / sheltered) → FINAL_LOOK |
| 4 | `BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT` | SEATED_TALK_OPENER (SELFIE talking-head) → SEATED_ANGLE_B (settled-glow lip-sync) → SEATED_ANGLE_C → SETTLED_GARMENT_DETAIL (hand-free, voiceover) → SEATED_ANGLE_D (settled-glow lip-sync) → second settled detail hand-free macro (voiceover) → FINAL_WRAP_AT_HOME (settled-glow lip-sync) → FINAL_LOOK |
| ≥5 | `BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP` | 8 pose / detail variations alternating previously-shown locations or new tier-matched rooms / outdoor spots (two of them hand-free detail macros = voiceover). Character in product throughout. Rules from K=1..4 apply per the matching location type. |

Slot 1 of Board K (K>1) picks up where Board K-1's Slot 8 left off — character in product outfit, hairstyle locked, lighting tier-matched, location follows the K-specific progression. No kraft bag. No pre-wear outfit. No reintroductions.

### First slot IS the PRE_WEAR moment (Board 1)

Unlike talking-head UGC, **Slot 1 of Board 1 MUST always show the character in pre-wear outfit holding/beside the kraft bag** — product NOT visible, NOT worn. This is a hard rule: the try-on story begins with the boring base → wow product contrast, and skipping the pre-wear moment breaks the entire arc.

The "wearing the product" beat lands in Slot 2 (WEARING), never Slot 1. Never default Slot 1 to "show character already in product" — that's a Slot 2 (WEARING) or Slot 7 (STYLE_POSE) beat for try-on, not Slot 1.

### Director override

If `input_tier == "director"`, map the user's beats 1:1 onto the 8 slots in their order — Director input may override the canonical arc above. The Outfit Continuity rule (S1 = pre-wear, S2+ = product), the Kraft Bag S1-only rule, and the Mirror Ban remain non-negotiable even under director.

---

## Step 4.5 — Slot Action Diversity (mandatory)

**The 8 slots MUST show eight DIFFERENT physical actions and framings, not variations of the same pose.** Same hand-product configuration in two adjacent slots = the storyboard reads as one frozen moment, not a story. Same pose with micro-variation (smile angle, head tilt) does NOT count as a different action. **Anti-morph:** every adjacent pair must differ in POV + distance band + action — Seedance snaps a boundary into a hard cut only when the two beats are visually FAR apart; two low-delta neighbors MORPH into a blend. No two adjacent slots share BOTH their POV and their distance band; across the 8, each distance band (TIGHT / MID / WIDE) appears at least twice.

**Every slot freezes its beat MID-EVENT — a body already in motion, never a neutral "standing by" frame.** Slot 1 opens already inside the moment (hand already clamped on the bag handle, grin already breaking — never walking up to the bag, never posed beside it waiting). Across the eight slots the board carries a mini-arc — introduce (S1-S2) → develop (S3-S6) → land (S7-S8) — and every plot beat that CAN be shown is shown as a visual: a visual beat costs zero words in the downstream audio.

### Default action per slot (Board 1 canonical try-on arc)

| Slot | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 (PRE_WEAR) | Character standing/seated relaxed in pre-wear outfit, kraft bag held in one hand at her side OR placed upright on the surface beside her (NEVER lifting / opening / inspecting the bag). Other hand free or holding phone (selfie POV). Glance can be at the bag with genuine anticipation, grin already breaking (register per Step 10). Product NOT visible. |
| 2 (WEARING) | Now in the product outfit, full body / three-quarter, alive stance with at least one visible mid-cut pose shift (weight transfer, hand-on-hip → arms-relaxed, hip-pop swap, small body rotation), one hand may smooth the front of the garment. Eyes meet lens or glance briefly aside then back. The board's genuine peak reaction face per the active Step 10 register (a real jaw-drop breaking into a warm grin by default) with mouth open mid-word — she is lip-syncing the Cut 2 audio across the locked frame. |
| 3 (FRONT_POSE) | Front-facing in the product, full-body / three-quarter at a DIFFERENT distance / POV from Slot 2, an alive stance that reads the whole silhouette head to toe (weight on one hip, a small rotation, one hand smoothing the front or resting). Eyes meet lens; mouth open mid-word lip-syncing the Cut 3 audio. |
| 4 (TEXTURE_CLOSEUP) | Hand-free macro: framing tight on the product's fabric / cut / texture detail. The character's hands stay at her sides / off-frame / clearly NOT in contact with the close-up garment area. Texture / cut / detail reads through framing, drape, light, and natural body micro-movement. NO skim / pull / lift / brush / pinch (own hand or otherwise). Voiceover slot — silent on camera. |
| 5 (TURN) | Mid-turn to show the SIDE / BACK of the garment — body already rotating, an over-the-shoulder glance to the lens or back-to-camera, the cut / drape reading from the new angle. Mouth open mid-word lip-syncing the Cut 5 audio. |
| 6 (DETAIL) | Second hand-free macro on a DIFFERENT garment detail than Slot 4 (hem / sleeve / collar / hardware / print / seam) — hands at sides / off-frame / clearly NOT in contact. Detail reads through drape and light. Voiceover slot — silent on camera. |
| 7 (STYLE_POSE) | One stylish pose-and-location combo (PICK ONE per board based on outfit vibe): seated in soft accent armchair (leg crossed casually) / window-seat in soft daylight (knees up or legs crossed) / leaning against doorframe (hands in pockets or one hand on frame) / mid-step walking confidently across hallway / on kitchen island (hand on counter, looking out) / on stairs (mid-step or seated) / on balcony with soft city light (leaning on rail). The pose is ALIVE — eyes catch the lens, mouth open mid-word as she lip-syncs the Cut 7 audio, body holds the styled pose with confident kinetic charge (slight weight shift, subtle head tilt, hand small-gesture allowed). |
| 8 (FINAL_LOOK) | Settled alive final wrap in the STYLE_POSE room (or a natural continuation) — a last confident look to the lens, a warm open grin or small delighted laugh, loop-ready mid-motion. Mouth open mid-word lip-syncing the Cut 8 audio. |

For Boards 2..N, the eight slot actions follow the K-specific 8-beat arc (Step 4 table). In EVERY K arc, the **two hand-free detail-macro slots are voiceover** (character silent on camera); the other six are lip-sync (mouth open mid-word). The eight-different-actions + anti-morph rules apply throughout:

- **`BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR`:** a bridge pose continuing the prior board's final room, then alive pose variations across DIFFERENT home rooms, with two hand-free garment-detail macros woven in (voiceover). Pose menu for the lip-sync slots: standing front with mid-cut pose shift, standing three-quarter with hip-pop swap, seated different chair, leaning against doorframe with mid-cut weight change, hand-on-hip-power, arms-crossed-cool, hand-in-hair, looking-back-over-shoulder.
- **`BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR`:** dry establishing → light rain begins and persists → walk / turn poses in the drizzle → two hand-free macros on wet droplets on fabric (no hand contact, see Step 9; voiceover) → post-rain or sheltered styled wrap. Hair stays dry across all slots (see Step 7d).
- **`BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT`:** settled seated talking-head opener (SELFIE) → settled pose variations (legs crossed differently, leaning on armrest, one knee up, hand-on-jaw, lounging back) in the settled-glow register → two hand-free macros on hem / sleeve / collar at rest (voiceover) → final settled wrap. Energy stays settled-glow, never explosive-scream.
- **`BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP` (K≥5):** follow the action menu matching each slot's location type (indoor home rooms → K=2 / K=4 menus; outdoor → K=3 menu); two hand-free detail macros are voiceover. The eight-different-actions rule applies.

### POV & distance cadence — the anti-morph engine (Board 1 and all K)

Adjacent slots must differ in BOTH POV and distance band so every boundary snaps as a hard cut. Walk the two axes down the 8 slots, honoring the try-on anchors:

- **POV anchors:** Slot 1 PRE_WEAR = SELFIE (casual home moment with the bag; `BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT` Slot 1 = SELFIE talking-head). The two hand-free macro slots (4 TEXTURE, 6 DETAIL) = STATIC close-up, no creator phone in frame. WEARING / FRONT_POSE / STYLE_POSE / FINAL_LOOK = STATIC locked-off (SELFIE acceptable when a pose is naturally one-handed, e.g. walking with the phone). Between anchors, alternate SELFIE ↔ STATIC so no two consecutive slots share a POV.
- **Distance anchors:** the two macro slots (4, 6) are TIGHT / MACRO; WEARING / FRONT_POSE / STYLE_POSE lean WIDE (full-body / three-quarter to read the fit); openers / talking-head lean MID. Rotate so no two adjacent slots share a band and each band (TIGHT / MID / WIDE) appears at least twice across the 8.

The slot description MUST explicitly state the framing distance — `TIGHT CLOSE-UP`, `MEDIUM CLOSE-UP`, `MEDIUM`, `MEDIUM-WIDE`, `MACRO`, `THREE-QUARTER`, `WAIST-UP`, `FULL-BODY`, `FULL-BODY-WIDE`. Every POV / distance change between slots aligns with the hard cut between them. If `input_tier == "director"` overrides POV, apply the override but keep adjacent slots distinct.

### Hard validation rules

- All 8 slots MUST show 8 DIFFERENT physical actions per the per-slot action table (or a Director override).
- **No two ADJACENT slots share BOTH their POV and their distance band** = REWRITE (that shared pair is the morph). Each distance band (TIGHT / MID / WIDE) appears at least twice across the 8.
- **For `BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL`:** Slot 1 MUST show the kraft bag and pre-wear outfit (product NOT worn, NOT visible). Slot 2 MUST show the character in the product outfit (kraft bag GONE, pre-wear GONE). **Slot 7 (STYLE_POSE) MUST be in a different room** of the same home, character still in product. Slots 4 and 6 are hand-free macros.
- **For `BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR`:** Slot 1 MUST continue the prior board's final location vibe (logical room continuation). The other lip-sync slots MUST move through DIFFERENT rooms of the same home (not yet shown), tier-matched. Character in product outfit throughout.
- **For `BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR`:** All 8 slots MUST be outdoor, tier-matched. Slot 1 dry, rain visible on fabric from Slot 2 onward, final slots post-rain or sheltered. Hair stays dry across all slots. No puddle / wet-glass reflections of the character.
- **For `BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT`:** All 8 slots MUST be indoor (1-2 tier-matched rooms). Character is settled (seated / lounging). Slot 1 may be SELFIE on-camera dialogue (talking-head reflection). Energy register settled-glow (not explosive-scream).
- **For `BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP` (K≥5):** Each slot's location type follows the loop pattern (alternate previously-shown / new tier-matched rooms or outdoor spots). Rules from the relevant K=1..4 location type apply.
- Every POV / distance change between slots aligns with a hard cut (per Step 5).

---

## Step 5 — Camera POV and Hand Allocation Per Slot

Each slot picks the POV that fits its action AND obeys the Hand Allocation Rule. **POV may change between slots — every POV change between slots aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition.**

### Camera POVs

| Action in slot | POV |
|---|---|
| Casual home moment with bag (S1) / unposed reaction / one-handed walking | **Arm's-length selfie** shot, slight handheld feel, character's phone-holding arm partially visible at the frame edge if natural |
| Full-body try-on (S2) / styled pose (S7) / two-handed adjustments | **Static-style** locked-off shot, character at proper distance for the framing |
| Tight texture / fabric / cut detail (S3) | **Static close-up** at chest/torso level |

### Hand Allocation Rule (hard constraint)

The character has exactly two hands. Count hands AND hand-roles before finalizing every slot — the total of simultaneous hand-roles written into a slot never exceeds two, and every described hand belongs to the character. The garment WORN on the body is never a hand-role — only acting hands count.

**One named role per hand (every slot's action line):**
- A one-hand action names the acting hand AND parks the other explicitly (holding the phone in selfie, resting at her side, on the armrest, flat on the counter).
- A two-hand action is legal when the action naturally needs both (adjusting the collar with both hands, hands in both pockets) — name both roles in ONE sentence and give the hands no other simultaneous job.
- An action load that implies an extra holder (holding the bag while smoothing the hem while waving = three jobs) = REWRITE — a phantom third hand renders. Rest a prop on a surface when a stabilizer hand would otherwise be needed, and sequence multi-step actions across the hard cuts between slots instead of piling jobs into one beat.

**Selfie POV (S1 default):**
- ONE hand of the character is holding the phone — fully off-frame or its edge (forearm / palm side) partially visible at the frame edge.
- Only the OTHER hand is available for action — holding ONE object total (the kraft bag in S1).
- If the slot requires holding two objects simultaneously OR any two-handed action → **Selfie is FORBIDDEN. Switch to Static.**

**Static POV (default for the non-selfie slots):**
- Both character hands are free.
- Phone is not in frame; no hand holds it.
- Suitable for any pose, two-handed adjustments, full-body framing.

**Decision tree per slot:**
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR + bag in one hand + free other hand → Selfie OK (default)
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR + bag set on surface, both hands free → Static OK (alternative)
- Slot 2 WEARING full-body try-on → Static (default)
- Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP hand-free macro → Static-close (NO hand contact with the garment; hands stay at sides / off-frame)
- Slot 7 STYLE_POSE → Static (default)
- Slot 7 mid-step walking with phone → Selfie acceptable

**Hard validation rule (must appear in the rendering rules of every prompt):**
`Count hands per slot. The character has exactly two hands. In selfie POV, one hand is occupied by the phone (off-frame or visible at edge), so only one hand is available for action — never depict the character holding two objects in selfie POV. If the slot's action requires two free hands, the slot must be static camera POV with the phone not in frame. Every slot names each hand's single role — the acting hand's job, the other hand parked explicitly — and the total simultaneous hand-roles never exceed two. POV may change between slots; every POV change aligns with a hard cut. No third arm, no extra hands, no duplicated limbs, no impossible grip.`

| Garment / item | Safe verbs | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| Top / shirt / blouse / tee | wears, smooths, adjusts hem, tucks in, untucks, brushes shoulder, pulls down sleeve, lifts cuff | stretches violently, yanks, wrings, tears |
| Dress / skirt | wears, smooths, adjusts hem, smoothes drape, pinches at waist | yanks, lifts hem indecently, twists violently |
| Pants / shorts | wears, smooths, adjusts at waist, tugs cuff | yanks, hikes up unnaturally |
| Outerwear / jacket / coat | wears, opens, adjusts collar, smooths lapels | tears off, throws |
| Shoes | wears, taps toe, lifts heel, adjusts strap | tears, bends |
| Handbag / accessory | holds, adjusts strap, lays on lap, sets on surface | crushes, deforms |

| Kraft paper bag (S1 only) | hand rests on handle, bag stands upright on surface, fingers graze handle | opens, peeks inside, lifts product out, vlogs the bag, crushes, deforms |

When unsure → wear-and-pose only.

## Step 7 — Garment Consistency Lock, Realistic Fit, and Weight & Grip Logic

When `product_media_id` is provided, Garment Consistency Lock is mandatory.

### Garment Consistency Lock — one product image
`@Image1 is the product reference (the garment / accessory). GARMENT CONSISTENCY LOCK: across every slot in which the product is worn, the visible garment must keep identical silhouette, identical primary color, identical secondary color or print pattern, identical recognizable design details (collar style, hem shape, sleeve, neckline, hardware, prints, stitching). The character may turn or pose freely — the garment rotates naturally with her body — but the garment itself never changes color, never changes print, never gains or loses recognizable details between slots.`

### Garment Consistency Lock — multiple product images
`@Image1 and additional product references show valid angles of the same garment. The product may appear only from these provided angles or natural body rotations of them. Switch angles only by hard cuts between slots, never by continuous rotation. Do not invent intermediate or unseen design details.`

Garment rules:
- The character may face the camera, turn three-quarter, turn back-to-camera, or move freely — the garment naturally rotates with her body. This is NOT a violation of the lock.
- Recognizable design details visible from the front in the reference must remain visible whenever the front is shown.
- Color, print, fabric texture, and silhouette stay identical across slots.
- Never invent design details not in the reference (no extra buttons, no extra pockets, no different hem).
- Hairstyle stays locked; shoes and accessories beyond what's in the reference may be added per Slot 7 outfit-complete rule, but never replace the product itself.

### Realistic Fit (mandatory)

The product MUST be rendered at realistic real-world proportions on the character's body. Fashion photography defaults to slimming / lengthening the wearer, but try-on UGC reads as fake when the fit is unrealistic. Render the garment as it would actually drape on the character's body type from the reference image.

Add explicitly to the prompt: `The product is rendered at realistic real-world proportions on the character's body — natural drape, natural fit, not exaggerated. Fabric falls naturally per its weight. The character's body proportions from the reference image stay consistent.`

### Weight & Grip Logic (accessories only)

For apparel (the typical try-on case), weight logic is not relevant — the character simply wears the garment. For accessory products, classify by weight before depicting the character holding/placing the accessory:

| Class | Examples | Hand allocation | Facial expression |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy | Large structured handbag, boots being put on | BOTH hands required, character leans slightly | Slight composed effort combined with the slot's try-on reaction (per the active Step 10 register) |
| Bulky but light | Oversized hat, large scarf | BOTH hands required for adjusting | NO strain — relaxed face, easy grip |
| Light | Sunglasses, small clutch, jewelry, watch | ONE hand or natural placement | Neutral / lively depending on the slot's expression beat (per the active Step 10 register), no strain |
| Tiny | Earrings, ring, small pin | Pinched between thumb and index finger, held close to lens | Focused / curious, no strain |

**Hand-relative sizing (accessories):** state the accessory's size relative to the character's hand plus approximate cm — "palm-sized clutch, ~15 cm wide, fits in one hand", "slim watch face, ~3 cm across, sits under the wrist bone". NEVER size by object comparison ("about the size of a water bottle") — object comparisons drift oversized in render; hand-relative sizing survives.

**Paired or set accessories (earrings sold as pair, gloves pair):** never stack or balance both halves on a single palm. One in each hand at chest level OR one displayed plus one set down OR both side-by-side on a flat surface. NEVER both halves balanced on one palm.

### Environmental Effects Exception (K=3 Outdoor only)

For `BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR`, the Garment Consistency Lock is preserved with respect to silhouette / primary color / print / recognizable design details — but environmental optical surface effects from rain / wind / outdoor light are NOT lock violations:

**ALLOWED on K=3:**
- Water droplets beading on the fabric surface (visible on shoulders, arms, hem, lapel)
- Slight surface sheen / wet shimmer in directional light
- Minor temporary darkening where droplets concentrate (does NOT shift the primary garment color — the underlying fabric color reads identical to dry K=1/K=2/K=4 slots)
- Wind-caught natural drape (hem moves, sleeve flutters slightly, scarf trails)
- Surface highlight bounce from wet pavement / overcast sky

**NOT allowed (still violates the Lock):**
- Garment fully soaked-through (significant color shift to darker hue)
- Fabric becoming see-through / transparent from water
- Print smearing or running
- Garment shape distortion from water weight
- Color reading as a different garment (e.g., navy reads as black-from-soak)
- Any structural change to design details (collar shape, hem length, button position)

The garment underneath the environmental effects MUST remain visibly identical to the dry K=1/K=2/K=4 slots — only the optical surface state changes.

---

## Step 7b — Kraft Bag Logic (mandatory for try-on)

The try-on opens with a single kraft paper shopping bag — the "I just got this" prop.

### Bag specification
- Single kraft paper shopping bag, plain brown craft paper texture
- **No logo, no brand, no shipping stickers, no print on the bag itself**
- Optional: handles tinted to match the product's primary color (small visual nod, never required)
- Slightly larger than the product would be when folded inside; not oversized
- Stands upright on a surface beside the character OR is held casually by one handle at the character's side

### Surface Placement (S1 only)

The bag rests on a surface in Slot 1 OR is held by one handle. Surface placement choice:

| Product size | Bag placement |
|---|---|
| Light apparel / accessory / jewelry | Held by one handle at side OR placed on table / console / counter beside character |
| Bulky outerwear / structured bag / shoes | Bag set upright on the floor beside character (still selfie or static camera OK), OR on a low bench / console |

Default to HELD-BY-HANDLE or TABLE-PLACED unless the product is clearly too large.

### Surface Aesthetic / Style

The surface where the bag rests (if not held) must match the room aesthetic visible in the character reference image — and default to a premium / clean look. The try-on reads as a "moment in someone's styled home", not a workbench scene.

Match by room:
- **Living room** → marble / light wood coffee table, sideboard, or styled console (white lacquer, oak, ash)
- **Bedroom** → vanity / bedside / dresser top — light wood, white lacquer, or mirrored finish
- **Kitchen** → marble / quartz counter, kitchen island, white-tile counter
- **Hallway / entry** → console table (white lacquer, marble, light wood)
- **Default if room ambiguous** → light wood, white lacquer, or marble — premium, clean, minimal

**Forbidden surfaces:**
- Workshop / workbench / utility table (dark scratched wood, visible tool marks, deep gouges)
- Industrial / garage / mechanic-style surfaces (metal grates, oil-stained surfaces, raw concrete)
- Plastic folding table, camping table, makeshift surfaces
- Surfaces with visible tools, screws, hardware, mechanic equipment around them
- Heavily-distressed dark masculine wood that reads as "garage" or "barn"
- Cluttered surfaces with unrelated objects (mail, papers, tools, food)

The surface should look like it belongs in a styled home — neutral / light tones, clean lines, no clutter.

### Forbidden bag actions in Slot 1
- **Character does NOT open the bag in frame.**
- **Character does NOT lift the product out of the bag in frame.**
- **Character does NOT vlog the bag, unwrap it, peek inside, or interact with the contents.**
- **Character does NOT address the bag itself** ("hi baby" to the bag) — the bag is a contextual prop, not a character.
- The bag is a contextual prop — that's it.

### Bag Behavior Across Slots

- **Slot 1 (PRE_WEAR):** Bag visible — held by one handle at side OR upright on a surface beside character. Product is NOT visible. Bag is the contextual prop.
- **Slot 2 (WEARING):** Bag GONE from frame entirely. Product is the new focal element on the character.
- **Slot 4 (TEXTURE_CLOSEUP):** Bag GONE. Product detail is the hero.
- **Slots 3, 5-6 (FRONT_POSE / TURN / DETAIL):** Bag GONE. Character + product only.
- **Slots 7-8 (STYLE_POSE / FINAL_LOOK):** Bag GONE. Character + product only, in a different room.

### Bag Forbidden States

- Never describe the character opening the bag, lifting the product out of it, or peeking inside.
- Never describe a cardboard delivery box, packing tape, tissue paper, knife, or any unboxing-style packaging — this is a try-on, not an unboxing.
- The bag stands on a flat surface or is held by one handle in Slot 1.
- After Slot 1, never re-introduce the bag.
- Never describe multiple bags — exactly one kraft bag per Slot 1.

---

## Step 7c — Outfit Continuity Logic (mandatory)

The try-on hinges on the visual contrast between the pre-wear base and the product outfit.

### Pre-wear outfit (Slot 1 of Board 1 ONLY)
- Gender-neutral boring base — basic tee + lounge pants / oversized hoodie + cotton shorts / simple robe / plain knit + sweatpants.
- Visually muted, never competing with the product (no bold prints, no statement pieces, neutral or muted colors).
- Comfortable, home-wear vibe.

### Product outfit (Slot 2 of Board 1 onward + every later slot)
- Per the product image / description — the garment being tried on.
- Worn naturally with realistic fit and drape.
- Once the character is in the product (S2 of Board 1), she stays in the product for the rest of the video. **The pre-wear outfit never returns.**

### Hairstyle continuity
- Hairstyle, hair color, and hair length stay identical across all slots and boards (matching the character reference image). Never re-style hair between slots.

### Outfit transition between Slot 1 and Slot 2
- The transition is implicit (handled by the hard cut between Slot 1 and Slot 2). The board does NOT depict the act of changing — Slot 1 ends with the character in pre-wear, Slot 2 begins with her in the product. Never depict the changing motion on the static board.

---

## Step 7d — Outdoor & Rain Logic (K=3 `BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR` only)

For K=3, all 8 slots are outdoor. Tier-matched to outfit + brand register.

### Outdoor location tier mapping

| Tier | Outdoor location examples |
|---|---|
| luxury | Upscale street / café terrace / promenade / park with refined architecture / gallery district / cobbled boutique quarter |
| premium | Modern urban walk / stylish café / plaza / city street with warm architecture / curated district |
| drugstore | Neighborhood walk / suburban street / local café terrace / park bench / corner shop area |

Lighting: overcast / cool neutral midday daylight. **Never golden hour, warm sunset, orange/amber cast, late-afternoon warm wash** unless `user_request` explicitly asks.

### Rain timing across the 8 slots

- **Slot 1 (OUTDOOR_ESTABLISH):** dry outdoor. Character outdoor in product outfit, no rain yet. Tier-matched establishing shot — full-body or three-quarter framing, walking / standing / casual outdoor pose. Pavement dry.
- **Slot 2 (OUTDOOR_IN_RAIN):** light rain begins. Character walking or standing in light drizzle. Water droplets become visible on the fabric (shoulders, arms, hem). Pavement may show slight wet sheen. Sky overcast.
- **Slot 4 (FABRIC_WATER_MACRO):** tight macro on the fabric surface — water droplets beading on the garment, light surface sheen, weave / print clear underneath water. **HAND-FREE** macro — no hand contact, no skim, no brush (see Step 9 Hand-Free Macro Logic — applies here too).
- **Slot 7 (OUTDOOR_STYLED_WRAP):** post-rain styled pose OR sheltered styled pose (under awning / café terrace covered seating / doorway). Droplets may still be visible on the fabric. Character settled, confident wrap pose. Pavement may still be wet (reflects sky light only, NOT the character — see No-Mirror rule below).

The remaining outdoor slots follow the canonical 8-beat arc outdoors with rain continuing: Slot 3 FRONT_POSE (full outdoor fit read, light drizzle), Slot 5 TURN (side / back of the garment mid-walk), Slot 6 DETAIL (second hand-free wet-fabric macro on a different detail than Slot 4, voiceover), Slot 8 FINAL_LOOK (settled outdoor final wrap). Every slot stays overcast / cool daylight, hair dry, no character reflections.

### Hair stays dry — mandatory across all 8 slots of K=3

Hairstyle is locked globally (matches character reference). In rain slots (S2 onward), hair MUST stay visibly dry. Choose ONE handling per slot:

- (a) **Light drizzle only** — rain is sparse enough that hair shows no wet strands; raindrops land on shoulders and fabric but not on hair (DEFAULT)
- (b) **Partial shelter** — character is just stepping out of cover / under partial awning edge / has just turned out of doorway; hair on the protected side
- (c) **Just-out-of-rain** — droplets on fabric, hair fully dry (already air-dried or pre-rain capture)
- (d) **Umbrella** — if `user_request` explicitly suggests umbrella, character may hold one (single-handed in selfie / two-handed in static camera, follows Hand Allocation Rule)

Never depict wet / soaked / dripping hair, even in rain slots.

### No-Mirror rule extends to puddle / wet-surface reflections

The strict No-Mirror / No-Reflection ban from Step 11 / Hard Restrictions still applies on K=3. Wet pavement, puddles, glass storefronts MUST NOT show the character's reflection. Wet surfaces may catch ambient sky light, but no character-visible reflective surfaces.

### Outdoor garment-water interaction (Slot 4 wet macro)

The Slot 4 macro shows water beading on the fabric — pick ONE garment-type cue:

| Garment type | K=3 Slot 4 wet macro cue |
|---|---|
| Silk / satin | Water beads roll off, surface sheen intensifies, weave still readable |
| Linen / cotton | Water droplets soak slightly into the surface but don't darken the underlying color, weave clearly visible |
| Leather | Water beads on top like glass, leather grain reads clearly |
| Denim | Droplets bead on the heavier denim surface, wash gradient unchanged |
| Knitwear / sweater | Droplets nestle in the weave texture without soaking through |
| Synthetic / waterproof | Water beads as if on a windshield, full surface sheen |
| Outerwear / jacket / coat | Droplets bead on the outer shell, water rolls off seams |

The macro stays HAND-FREE — character's hands at sides / off-frame.

---

## Step 7e — Home Reflect Mode (K=4 `BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT` only)

For K=4, all 8 slots are back inside the home — character settled in 1-2 tier-matched rooms (may be primary location from Board 1, or a new room not yet shown across Boards 1-3). The vibe is "now that I've worn this — honest verdict" reflection.

### Home Reflect location

Tier-matched indoor:
- luxury → curated armchair corner / window-seat with soft daylight / styled sofa with linen cushions / kitchen island with marble counter
- premium → modern sofa / window-seat / kitchen island / bedroom corner with plants
- drugstore → cozy sofa / kitchen chair / bed corner with throw pillows / soft armchair

May be 1 room throughout, or 2 adjacent rooms (e.g., living room → kitchen).

### Slot beats

- **Slot 1 (SEATED_TALK_OPENER):** Character seated comfortably (sofa / armchair / bed-edge / window-seat). **SELFIE POV by default** — talking-head reflection framing, character speaks visibly on camera (mouth moves, lip-syncing the Cut 1 audio segment in the downstream video). MEDIUM CLOSE-UP or MEDIUM framing.
- **Slot 2 (SEATED_DIFFERENT_ANGLE):** Same or different room, different seated/lounging pose (legs crossed differently / leaning on armrest / hand on lap / one knee up / lounging back). STATIC framing, MEDIUM-WIDE or THREE-QUARTER. Character speaks visibly on camera in settled-glow register (mouth moves mid-word, lip-syncing the Cut 2 audio segment in the downstream video).
- **Slot 3 (SEATED_FRONT_READ):** Seated or gently standing front-on to the lens, letting the full worn fit read from the settled context (a small shift forward, smoothing the front of the garment across the lap). STATIC, MEDIUM-WIDE or THREE-QUARTER at a DIFFERENT distance/POV from Slot 2. Lip-sync slot (mouth open mid-word, Cut 3 audio).
- **Slot 4 (SETTLED_GARMENT_DETAIL):** Hand-free macro on hem / sleeve / collar / fabric drape at rest. Character partially visible (lap / torso / shoulder). MACRO or TIGHT CLOSE-UP. The macro is HAND-FREE — character's hands stay off the garment (per Step 9 rules). Voiceover layered downstream — character silent on camera in this slot only.
- **Slot 5 (SEATED_TURN_OR_SHIFT):** A settled turn — shifting to show the side / back of the garment from the seated pose, an over-the-shoulder glance to the lens, or rising to move to the adjacent room. STATIC, a DIFFERENT distance/POV from Slot 4. Lip-sync slot (mouth open mid-word, Cut 5 audio).
- **Slot 6 (SETTLED_SECOND_DETAIL):** Second hand-free macro on a DIFFERENT garment detail than Slot 4 (hem / sleeve / collar / hardware / print / seam). Character partially visible, hands off the garment. Voiceover layered downstream — character silent on camera in this slot only.
- **Slot 7 (SETTLED_STYLE_POSE):** A styled settled pose in the second reflection room (or a stronger anchor of the same room) — leg crossed casually on an accent chair, window-seat in soft daylight, on the kitchen island. STATIC MEDIUM-WIDE or FULL-BODY. Confident settled-glow expression, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing the Cut 7 audio.
- **Slot 8 (FINAL_WRAP_AT_HOME):** Character settled in final at-home pose (may match Slot 1 or 2 setup, or a fresh settled pose). STATIC MEDIUM-WIDE or FULL-BODY at a DIFFERENT distance/POV from Slot 7. Slight glance to lens, settled-confident expression, mouth open mid-word or mid-sentence lip-syncing the Cut 8 audio in settled-glow register.

### Energy register for K=4

The active expression pattern (Step 10) applies in a **settled-glow / contented-victorious** register, NOT explosive-scream. Under the NATURAL default: "I've worn this all day and I am still quietly delighted about it" — warm grin OK, soft laugh OK, glowing eyes OK, body settled. Under Pattern B (ONLY on explicit hype signals): sustained hyped in settled-glow — wide warm grin, head-thrown-back laughter OK, but the body posture is settled (seated / lounging), not jumping / lifting.

### Garment Consistency Lock applies normally

No environmental effects on K=4 (back inside, dry). Garment color / print / silhouette / details identical to K=1/K=2 indoor slots.

### Hand Allocation on K=4

Slot 1 SELFIE — one hand holds phone (off-frame or at edge), one hand free (lap / armrest / smoothing fabric / fingers laced). Slots 2-8 STATIC — both hands free, settled in lap / on armrest / one hand near jaw or temple / gestures while talking. The macro slots (4, 6) — hands off the garment.

---

## Step 8 — Product Placement & Visibility Logic

For try-on, the "product" is what the character is wearing.

### Visibility per slot

- **Slot 1 PRE_WEAR**: product is INSIDE the kraft bag — NOT visible at all. Character is in pre-wear outfit.
- **Slot 2 WEARING**: product is fully worn — visible head-to-(toe-or-knees) per FULL-BODY framing. Character is in the product outfit.
- **Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP**: product is the focal subject — fabric / cut / detail fills the frame, character partially visible.
- **Slot 7 STYLE_POSE**: product is fully visible on the character — natural pose framing.

### Forbidden placements (must appear in the rendering rules)

`Forbidden product placements: product peeking out of the kraft bag in Slot 1 — the bag is closed and the product is fully inside, not visible. Product hanging on a hanger, draped on a chair, laid on a bed instead of being worn (after Slot 1). Multiple copies of the product — exactly ONE garment / accessory at a time, and no look-alike garment of similar color / silhouette anywhere else in the slot (draped on a chair, hanging in an open closet, worn by a passerby) — the worn product is the only garment of its kind in frame. Product floating in mid-air, magically dressing the character — Slot 2 begins with her already in the product (cut handles the transition). The product is either fully hidden inside the closed kraft bag (Slot 1), fully visible worn by the character (Slots 2-8), or absent from the frame. Every prop holds exactly ONE state per slot — the kraft bag is closed and either held OR standing upright, never both, never half-open; state changes happen across the hard cut between slots, never inside a slot.`

---

## Step 9 — Hand-Free Macro Logic (the macro slots — Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP and Slot 6 DETAIL)

Slot 4 (TEXTURE_CLOSEUP) shows the product's fabric / cut / detail through framing and natural body movement, NOT through hand interaction. **NO touching, NO skimming, NO pulling, NO brushing, NO pinching** — hands stay at sides / off-frame / clearly NOT in contact with the close-up garment area.

The texture / cut / detail reads through ONE of these passive movement cues per slot, picked by garment type:

| Garment type | Slot 4 / Slot 6 hand-free movement cue (pick ONE per slot) |
|---|---|
| Top / shirt / blouse / tee | Light catches the chest area as she breathes / shoulder seam visible as the body settles / fabric falls naturally over the chest with slight body sway |
| Dress | Skirt drapes naturally as the body settles / waist seam visible as she breathes / bodice catches light across the panel |
| Skirt | Skirt drape settles in the locked frame / side seam visible / fabric reads pleat structure as light shifts |
| Pants / shorts | Fabric falls along the leg with natural drape / cuff sits naturally / seam line visible in close-up framing |
| Outerwear / jacket / coat | Lapel sits open with collar settled / shoulder seam reads / fabric texture catches the light |
| Knitwear / sweater | Knit texture catches light / shoulder seam visible / weave reads clearly in macro framing |
| Denim | Wash gradient visible / seam line reads / fabric grain catches light |
| Leather | Grain catches light / sheen reads naturally / surface plays in directional light |
| Accessories | Catches light / sits naturally / detail reads in macro framing |

General rules:
- ONE hand-free movement cue per slot. Never multiple.
- The character's hands stay at her sides / off-frame / behind the back / clearly NOT in contact with the close-up garment area.
- The garment stays in place — only natural drape / light / breath movement.
- **NO "operator hand"** — no hand from outside the character's body enters the close-up frame.
- The character does NOT touch her own clothing in the close-up framing — even gentle brushing reads as "someone touching her clothes during filming" in the rendered video.

---

## Step 10 — Human Performance Direction

Each slot includes specific micro-behaviors so the character feels alive. **Default emotional register is NATURAL — a lively, engaged, genuinely delighted creator wired through the try-on arc (real anticipation on the bag, ONE genuine peak on the WEARING reveal, engaged admiration on texture, warm confident victory on the style pose) — reactions at human scale: a real jaw-drop, a breaking grin, a delighted laugh, never staged screaming. Keep the beats expressive: the downstream video model under-renders energy, and a flat-neutral prompt renders a wooden presenter.** Pick predominantly from the NATURAL menu below. Switch to the HYPED register (the hyped menu + Pattern B) ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals a hyped register: `hyped`, `hype`, `energetic`, `explosive`, `high-energy`, `viral energy`, `insane energy`. Switch to calm-register beats ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals one of: `goth`, `vampire`, `cinematic noir`, `cold`, `passive`, `deadpan`, `clinical`, `refined`, `luxury-passive`, `minimal`, `somber`, `serious`, `dark`, `shadowy`, `posh-restrained`, `runway-cool` tone or aesthetic. The `user_request` word always wins.

**NATURAL menu (default):** slight lean toward camera, glance down then back to lens, raised brows with a genuine grin breaking, eyebrow raise, head tilt, hand gesture (NOT on the garment in the macro slots), shoulder shift, hair tuck, quick grin, small bright laugh, half-laugh through the nose, surprised blink, lean-in toward the lens, satisfied exhale, satisfied nod, small nod, casual laugh, pointing at product (only when product is worn, never inside the bag), holding garment hem closer to camera (worn-garment slots only, never the macro slots), tapping label, posture shift, pause before reveal, chin tuck with raised brow, eye-roll then quick grin back to lens, mock-confused squint, thumb-wipe at corner of mouth.

**HYPED menu (ONLY on the explicit hype signals above):** wide-eyed mock-gasp, mouth open mid-"wait", mouth open mid-yell hook, mid-recoil head jerk back, cheeks puffed mid-react, lips pursed in mock-OK chef's-kiss, eyebrows shooting straight up.

**Calm-register beats (ONLY on the calm signals above):** dramatic deadpan stare into lens, settled gaze, slow controlled gesture, quiet half-smile, satisfied exhale, small nod, deliberate stillness.

Avoid as a sole descriptor:
- "smiles at the camera"
- "looks at the camera"
- "poses for the camera"
- "stands in front of the camera wearing the outfit"
- "excited" / "happy" / "confident" / "hyped" as a bare mood word — every expression beat names what the brows, eyes, mouth, shoulders, and hands are DOING ("brows shooting up, mouth breaking open mid-laugh, shoulders lifting"), never an adjective alone
- "showing off the outfit" / "presenting the product" — name the concrete physical action instead
- identical expression across all slots
- this avoid list targets prompt-writing clichés only — it never dilutes the active pattern's performance register; expression beats always pair the mood word with named body mechanics

### Peak body events (pair with the peak-expression slots)

Under the NATURAL default (and Patterns A/C), ONLY the board's single peak slot (S2 WEARING by default) pairs the face with ONE full-body reaction event — the body sells the peak, never the face alone, and the event stays genuine: a real reaction caught mid-motion at human scale, never theatrical. Under Pattern B (ONLY on explicit hype signals) BOTH peak-expression slots (S2 WEARING and S7 STYLE_POSE) pair, a DIFFERENT event each. Pick ONE per pairing slot; a body event REPLACES a micro-behavior from the menu above, never stacks on top of one:

- hand flying to the chest mid-gasp (one hand — selfie-safe)
- both hands framing the face in disbelief (static camera only)
- leaning back wide-eyed, caught mid-recoil
- double-take frozen mid-whip back to the lens
- covering mouth, eyes crescent with escaping laughter
- head thrown back mid-laugh, shoulders lifted
- full-body lift onto toes, arms flared (static camera only)

The macro slots (4, 6) are exempt — the hand-free macro keeps its single passive movement cue and never carries a body event. Every body event obeys the Hand Allocation Rule (two-handed events force static camera POV) and the Step 6 safe-verb table, and the event's hands draw from the slot's two-hand budget — a two-handed event (both hands framing the face) leaves no hand for garment-smoothing or a prop; park or drop the other hand-beat.

**Register gate:** on K=4 (settled-glow, seated / lounging, never jumping / lifting) and any other settled-register slot, the menu restricts to the seated-safe events — hand flying to the chest, covering mouth, double-take, leaning back — never the full-body lift onto toes and never head thrown back with shoulders lifted. The both-peak-slots pairing applies only under Pattern B (explicit hype signals); under the NATURAL default and Patterns A and C pair only events that live inside the register's genuine human scale, on the single peak slot; under Pattern D that typically means none of the menu qualifies — its S2 rise and S7 closing lift come from the contour's gaze / posture / exhale mechanics, not the menu.

### Expression progression — three-register gate wired through the canonical arc

By default use **Pattern N (natural engaged)** for every board, channelled through the 8-slot try-on arc. Switch to **Pattern B** ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals a hyped register (`hyped`, `hype`, `energetic`, `explosive`, `high-energy`, `viral energy`, `insane energy`). Switch to Pattern A, C, or D ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals a calm-tone aesthetic (`goth`, `vampire`, `cinematic noir`, `cold`, `passive`, `deadpan`, `clinical`, `refined`, `luxury-passive`, `minimal`, `somber`, `serious`, `dark`, `shadowy`, `posh-restrained`, `runway-cool`). The `user_request` word always wins. Never repeat the same expression beat across slots within one board.

**Pattern N — natural engaged (DEFAULT — no signals needed)**
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR: genuine anticipation — eyes bright on the kraft bag, grin already breaking, fingers already on the handle, a real "it's finally here" energy at human scale. Mouth open mid-word lip-syncing the Cut 1 opener.
- Slot 2 WEARING: the board's ONE genuine peak — a real jaw-drop breaking into a wide warm grin, eyes lit on the new look, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 2, one hand smoothing the front of the garment with the other parked; delighted and lively, never staged screaming.
- Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP: engaged admiration — lips parted, eyes locked on the detail, a quiet "oh this is good" focus. Hands stay OFF the garment per the hand-free rule. Character silent on camera in this slot (voiceover layered downstream).
- Slot 7 STYLE_POSE: warm confident victory — open grin or a small delighted laugh, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 7, posture proud and settled; the energy reads "I look great in this" — genuine, never theatrical.
- Performed by a natural, engaged creator — genuine reactions, lively but human, never staged screaming energy.

**Pattern B — sustained INSANELY hyped (HYPED — ONLY on the explicit hype signals above: hyped / hype / energetic / explosive / high-energy / viral energy / insane energy)**
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR: WILD anticipation peak — jaw dropped wide, eyes blown wide on the kraft bag, hand clamped on the bag handle, sharp inhale, full-body explosive "this is here, this is the moment" energy. Mouth open mid-word lip-syncing the Cut 1 opener (the personal-want arrival hook lands here). The energy is pumped to 11 on the BAG — never restrained, never neutral.
- Slot 2 WEARING: peak hyped reaction on the new look — wide warm grin blown open with mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 2, eyes blown wide forward in disbelief at how good it looks, body radiating delight, one hand smoothing the front of the garment with explosive joy, full-body lift through the shoulders. Energy is AT PEAK throughout the settle — NEVER de-escalate, NEVER `half-smile`, NEVER `subtle reaction`. The mouth being open mid-talk is part of the peak energy, not against it.
- Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP: hyped admiration peak — lips parted in awed "ooooh" shape, brows skyward, eyes locked on the detail, energy NEVER drops. NOT calm inspection — this is "I cannot believe how perfect this fabric / cut is" hyped admiration. Hands stay OFF the garment per the hand-free rule. Character is silent on camera in this slot (voiceover layered downstream).
- Slot 7 STYLE_POSE: massive open grin / burst of laughter / head thrown back / full-body explosive victory, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 7 — peak-victory wrap pose. Never settle to `warm` or `satisfied` — the energy is "I look absolutely incredible in this" celebration, delivered mid-sentence.

**Pattern A — classic UGC try-on arc (override: warm-but-restrained briefs)**
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR: anticipation / curiosity / mild excitement; eyes on the bag, fingers on the handle, soft hopeful smile
- Slot 2 WEARING: peak warm reaction / wide-eyed delight; eyes wide on the new look, mouth slightly parted, eyebrows raised
- Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP: focused admiration / inspection; brows softened, lips parted in study, attention locked on the detail
- Slot 7 STYLE_POSE: settled satisfaction / warm grin / ownership; relaxed shoulders, content half-smile, posture proud

**Pattern C — deadpan-then-crack (override: dry-humor / detached / cool briefs)**
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR: dramatic deadpan stare at the bag (no smile, brows neutral)
- Slot 2 WEARING: break-character grin or laugh as she settles into the product outfit
- Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP: relaxed grin while admiring the detail
- Slot 7 STYLE_POSE: quick satisfied exhale, relaxed wrap

**Pattern D — sustained passive / restrained (override: goth / vampire / clinical / luxury-passive / cinematic noir / posh-restrained / runway-cool briefs)**
- Slot 1 PRE_WEAR: low-key opener — neutral face, half-lidded gaze on the bag, no expression spike
- Slot 2 WEARING: minimal reaction during the settle — slow controlled gestures, no facial spike, eyes resting forward
- Slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP: quiet focused study — settled gaze on the detail
- Slot 7 STYLE_POSE: settled close — quiet half-smile or neutral runway wrap; never high-energy

**Temperature contour:** Pattern N (the default) carries its own build — engaged open → build through the settle → ONE genuine peak on S2 → warm confident lift on S7 — its slot beats stand as written; never flatten it into one register and never inflate it into sustained peak. For the calm override patterns (A / C / D): shape the eight slots as flat → build → settle → spike — restrained beats, one clear rise, settled beats, one closing lift — so even calm boards breathe instead of holding one flat register (Patterns A and C already follow this shape; keep it when adapting them per K). For Pattern D the rise (S2) and closing lift (S7) stay inside the restrained register — a slow gaze lift, a posture straightening, a held exhale — never a facial spike; Pattern D's slot beats stand as written. Pattern B (hype signals only) is exempt: its sustained-peak law stands as written — peak throughout, K-register variants below, never reshaped into a build.

### Register variants per K

The active pattern (Pattern N by default; Pattern B only on explicit hype signals) adapts its register to the K-specific arc.

Under the NATURAL default (Pattern N), the same K adaptation applies at human scale:

- **K=1, K=2:** lively engaged delight — genuine grin, bright eyes, real energy in the body, never staged.
- **K=3:** grounded outdoor confidence — a real smile, easy body language walking in the rain; reads as "owning this fit even in the rain".
- **K=4:** settled-glow quiet contentment — warm grin, soft laugh, body calm-settled.
- **K≥5:** match the location type's register (indoor → K=1/K=2; outdoor → K=3; settled reflection → K=4).

When Pattern B is active (ONLY on explicit hype signals), its visual register adapts per K:

- **K=1, K=2 (`BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL`, `BOARD_2_TRY_ON_HOME_TOUR`):** full INSANELY hyped — peak grin, peak eye-light, body radiating energy throughout (the canonical try-on reveal + home-tour vibe).
- **K=3 (`BOARD_3_TRY_ON_OUTDOOR`):** hyped but grounded in outdoor body language — full grin, glowing eyes, body confidence walking in the rain / standing wet-confident. Energy reads as "I'm out here owning this fit even in the rain". The rain doesn't dampen the energy.
- **K=4 (`BOARD_4_TRY_ON_HOME_REFLECT`):** hyped in **settled-glow** register — sustained warm grin, contented victorious energy, eyes lit but body is calm-settled (seated / lounging), NOT explosive-scream. Read as "I've lived in this all day and I am still beaming".
- **K≥5 (`BOARD_K_TRY_ON_LOOP`):** match the location type's pattern variant — indoor home rooms use K=1/K=2 register; outdoor uses K=3 register; settled-reflection moments use K=4 register.

For Boards 2..N, Slot 1 picks up where Board K-1's Slot 8 left off (sustaining the same energy register transitioning into the new K-arc's register) and continues evolving across the 8 slots.

### Physical quirk moment (ONLY when `user_request` signals one)

When `user_request` names a physical signature quirk (a recurring gesture, a wink, a two-finger collarbone tap, a signature spin), give it exactly ONE dedicated slot moment in the whole board — and stage it LARGE: the acting body part fills its zone of the frame ("her hand fills the lower third of the frame, one sharp tap on the collarbone"), mechanics written ~30% bigger than life. Quirks written small do not survive the render. Placement rules: never in a macro slot (Slot 4 or Slot 6, hand-free), never on or in the kraft bag, always through the Step 6 safe-verb table, always inside the Hand Allocation Rule. Never invent a quirk the user didn't signal, and never repeat it in a second slot.

---

## Step 11 — UGC Visual Style Inside Each Slot

Photorealistic iPhone stills:
- Natural light (default: inherited from character reference image, biased to `tier`) — one motivated source (window / lamp / daylight), consistent white balance
- Slight phone-camera grain — reads as faint digital sensor noise in the shadows, never film grain
- Realistic skin texture — pore-level realism (vellus hair, natural asymmetry), no smoothing, no beauty-filter glow
- iPhone front-camera optics: wide 23mm-equivalent look, DEEP focus (background stays sharp — no shallow depth of field, no bokeh), slight wide-angle distortion at frame edges (mild phone wideness only — never fisheye, never ultra-wide warp), mild HDR flattening with slight highlight clipping at the window
- Real home environment (tier-matched)
- Outfit per Outfit Continuity rule (S1 = pre-wear, S2+ = product)
- Imperfect framing, mild handheld feel only on selfie slots
- Authentic creator energy
- No studio lighting, no glossy retouching, no cinematic lens, no cinematic color grade, no lens flare unless `user_request` explicitly asks — UGC that looks like cinema reads as an ad
- **No mirror or reflection shots** (strict ban)
- **K=3 outdoor specific:** cool neutral outdoor daylight, overcast / midday, natural rain visuals (no orange / amber / sunset cast); wet pavement reflects sky NOT the character; hair stays dry throughout all 8 slots
- **K=4 home reflect specific:** indoor warm-but-neutral home lighting matching prior boards' time-of-day; character settled in seated / lounging context throughout all 8 slots

---

## Step 12 — Sheet Layout

### Layout
- Exactly 8 slots in ONE horizontal row, left to right. Do NOT make two rows or a grid — never ten, never twelve panels.
- All slots have identical dimensions: exact 9:16 vertical rectangles.
- Slots are separated by thin white gutters.
- Sheet background is clean white between slots.
- **Total sheet aspect: 21:9.**
- No header, no footer, no surrounding chrome.
- **All eight slots are always active. There are no placeholder slots.**

### Active slots
- Photorealistic UGC iPhone still inside the slot.
- No on-image text, no captions, no badges, no numbers, no pop-text, no subtitles, no watermarks, no labels.
- The product itself (prints / labels visible on the garment) keeps real text accurately — that's part of the garment itself, not added typography. It is the ONLY legal text on the sheet: never mirrored, never reversed, never restyled. When a garment print or lettering is described in words (not carried by the reference image), it is BIG — a bold graphic or wordmark filling the chest or back: small logos and tiny lettering render as gibberish, large letterforms render clean, and described lettering is always fictional.
- No legible text and no numbers on ANY prop or surface other than the garment's own print (bag, pillows, mugs, wall art, packaging, signage) — rendered prop text comes out as gibberish or a real brand. The product's name / wordmark never bleeds onto any other object.

---

## Step 13 — Rendering Rules

The final image prompt must demand:
- Exactly 8 slots, identical size, exact 9:16 each, single horizontal row, total sheet aspect 21:9.
- Thin white gutters between slots.
- All eight slots active — no placeholders.
- Photorealistic UGC iPhone stills, no text overlays of any kind.
- Consistent character identity across all eight slots.
- **Outfit Continuity:** S1 of Board 1 = pre-wear outfit + kraft bag visible. S2 of Board 1 onward + all slots of Boards 2..N = product outfit, kraft bag GONE.
- **Garment Consistency Lock:** silhouette / color / print / recognizable details identical across every slot in which the product is worn.
- **Realistic Fit**: product drapes naturally on the character's body, real-world proportions, not exaggerated.
- **Bag rules enforced** — Slot 1 kraft bag held by handle or upright on premium surface, Slots 2-8 bag GONE, never re-introduced. Bag never opened on camera, never peeked into, never product lifted out of it on camera.
- **Hand-free macro in the macro slots (4 and 6)** — no hand contact with the fabric / cut / detail; texture reads through framing, drape, light, and breath only.
- **Product placement is clean** — fully worn (Slots 2-8), fully hidden inside the closed kraft bag (Slot 1), or absent. Never half-sticking out, never peeking from the bag, never on a hanger.
- **Hand count enforced** — character has exactly two hands. Selfie POV occupies one hand with the phone, leaving one for action. Two-handed actions force static camera POV. Each hand carries ONE named role per slot, the idle hand parked explicitly; total simultaneous hand-roles never exceed two (Step 5).
- **POV may change between slots** — every POV change aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition.
- Setting and lighting tier-matched. Slots 7-8 in a different room of the same home (tier-matched). Hairstyle identical across all slots.
- When a previous-board reference is provided (K > 1), identity / location-tier / lighting / product / hairstyle MUST match the reference unless the story explicitly demands a room change (K≥3 only).
- **No mirror or reflection shots** (strict). No bathroom mirror, no full-length mirror, no shop window reflection, no phone-screen reflection, no any reflective surface showing the character. NO "mirror selfie" shots even when the framing is selfie POV. Reflective surfaces are a limb factory — they spawn extra hands and duplicated bodies.
- **Exactly one hero product** — no duplicate copy and no look-alike garment of similar color / silhouette anywhere in any slot while the product is worn.
- **One state per prop per slot** — the bag closed and either held or standing (never both, never half-open); the product fully worn or fully hidden; every prop state change happens across a hard cut, never inside a slot.
- No deformed hands. No third arm, no extra hands, no duplicated limbs. No duplicated person. No additional brands or IP. No legible text or numbers on any prop or surface other than the garment's own print. No watermarks. No subtitles. No captions. No headers. No metadata. No pop text. No badges. No numbers. No fisheye lens. No ultra-wide distortion. No shallow depth of field. No bokeh. No lens flare. No cinematic color grade. No beauty filter — drop ONLY these last five negatives (shallow depth of field through beauty filter) when `user_request` explicitly asks for a cinematic look; every negative before them always stays.

## Required Prompt Template

The template below is the K=1 (`BOARD_1_TRY_ON_CANONICAL`) reference. For K=2/3/4/≥5, adapt the per-slot descriptions to the K-specific arc per Step 4 tables (K=2 home tour / K=3 outdoor with rain / K=4 home reflect / K≥5 loop). The overall sheet structure (8 slots, 21:9, white gutters, all eight active) and the rendering rules remain identical across all K values.

Use this structure inside the `prompt` field of your output:

```
[@Image1 product reference + GARMENT CONSISTENCY LOCK if product is present.] [@Image2 character reference, or @Image1 if no product.] [@Image3 previous-board reference if K > 1, with explicit instruction to preserve identity / location / lighting / wardrobe / product / hairstyle from this reference.] The same person appears in every slot with identical face, hair, body, and identity — no changes to features, hair, or proportions between slots.

A single ultra-wide horizontal storyboard sheet composed of exactly EIGHT equal-size 9:16 vertical slots arranged in ONE HORIZONTAL ROW, separated by thin white gutters on a clean white background, total sheet aspect 21:9. Do NOT make two rows and do NOT make a grid — exactly eight panels in one row, never ten, never twelve. All eight slots are active photorealistic UGC iPhone-style stills that tell a sequential try-on story across one continuous [clip_duration]-second video clip as eight beats — slot 1 PRE_WEAR (pre-wear outfit holding/beside a kraft paper shopping bag, product NOT visible), slot 2 WEARING (now in the product outfit, kraft bag GONE, genuine peak reaction), slot 3 FRONT_POSE (front-facing full fit), slot 4 TEXTURE_CLOSEUP (hand-free macro on fabric / cut / detail, character silent — voiceover), slot 5 TURN (side / back of the garment), slot 6 DETAIL (second hand-free macro on a different detail, voiceover), slot 7 STYLE_POSE (different room of the same home, styled pose, confident victory), slot 8 FINAL_LOOK (settled final wrap). There are no placeholder slots. Each adjacent pair of slots is a DIFFERENT camera setup — different POV + distance band + action — so every beat boundary reads as a crisp hard cut, not a morph.

Setting and lighting in slots 1-6 default to the same home environment, time of day, and light direction visible in the character reference image (and previous-board reference if provided), with a tier-matched aesthetic. Slots 7-8 are in a different room of the same home, tier-matched to the outfit's vibe. Hairstyle identical across all slots.

OUTFIT CONTINUITY: in Slot 1 the character wears a boring/neutral home base outfit (basic tee + lounge pants / oversized hoodie + cotton shorts / plain knit + sweatpants / simple robe — gender-neutral default, visually muted). In Slots 2-8 the character wears the product outfit (the garment from @Image1). Once in the product, she stays in the product. The kraft bag appears ONLY in Slot 1 — visible held by one handle at her side OR set upright on a surface beside her, plain brown kraft paper, no logo, no branding. The bag does NOT appear in Slots 2-8. Character does NOT open the bag in frame, does NOT lift the product out of the bag, does NOT peek inside, does NOT interact with the bag's contents.

Garment Consistency Lock (when product is present): the garment shows identical silhouette, color, print, and recognizable design details in every slot in which it appears (Slots 2-8). The character may turn or pose freely — the garment rotates naturally with her body. The product is rendered at realistic real-world proportions on the character's body — natural drape, natural fit, not exaggerated.

The character has exactly two hands. In selfie POV slots (Slot 1 default), one hand is occupied by the phone (off-frame or visible at edge), so only one hand is available for action — never two objects in selfie POV. Every slot names what EACH hand is doing — one role per hand, the idle hand parked explicitly (holding the phone, resting at her side, on the armrest) — never more than two simultaneous hand-roles; the garment worn on the body is not a hand-role. Slots requiring two free hands are static camera POV with the phone not in frame. POV may change between slots — every POV change aligns with a hard cut between slots, never a smooth transition.

Slot 1 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [selfie POV / static camera POV] (PRE_WEAR): [camera framing distance, character in pre-wear outfit, single kraft paper shopping bag held by one handle at her side OR placed upright on a premium surface beside her, product NOT visible, explicit hand allocation naming BOTH hands' roles (e.g. "right hand rests on the bag handle, left hand holds the phone off-frame"), captured MID-EVENT — hand already on the bag handle, grin already breaking, never a neutral standing frame — genuine anticipation expression per the active Step 10 register with explicit micro-behaviors, light/setting note tier-matched].

Slot 2 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [static camera POV] (WEARING): [camera framing distance (full-body or three-quarter), character now wearing the product outfit, settled stance, both hands free, the board's genuine peak reaction expression per the active Step 10 register — by default a real jaw-drop breaking into a wide warm grin, eyes lit on the new look (eyes blown wide only under the hyped register), one hand smoothing the front of the garment with the other hand parked at her side, paired with ONE full-body peak body event per Step 10 drawing from the same two-hand budget (e.g., hand flying to the chest mid-gasp / head thrown back mid-laugh — kept genuine and human-scale under the NATURAL default), kraft bag GONE from frame, light/setting note].

Slot 3 — exact 9:16 vertical still, [POV / distance different from Slot 2] (FRONT_POSE): [front-facing full-body or three-quarter reading the whole fit head to toe, an alive stance (weight on one hip, a small rotation, one hand smoothing the front or resting, the other parked), eyes to lens, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 3, kraft bag GONE, explicit hand allocation naming BOTH hands' roles].

Slot 4 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [static camera POV] (TEXTURE_CLOSEUP): [tight macro on the product's fabric / cut / detail through framing only — NO HAND CONTACT WITH THE FABRIC. The character's hands stay at her sides / off-frame / clearly NOT touching the garment. Texture / cut / detail reads through framing, drape, and light. Character partially visible (partial face / torso, no hand inside the close-up frame), silent on camera (voiceover slot), engaged admiration expression — lips parted, eyes locked on the detail (the awed "ooooh" version only under the hyped register)].

Slot 5 — exact 9:16 vertical still, [POV / distance different from Slot 4] (TURN): [mid-turn showing the SIDE or BACK of the garment — body already rotating, an over-the-shoulder glance to the lens or back-to-camera, the cut / drape reading from the new angle, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 5, kraft bag GONE, explicit hand allocation].

Slot 6 — exact 9:16 vertical still, [static camera close-up] (DETAIL): [second hand-free macro on a DIFFERENT garment detail than Slot 4 (hem / sleeve / collar / hardware / print / seam) — NO HAND CONTACT, hands at her sides / off-frame; detail reads through drape and light; character partially visible, silent on camera (voiceover slot)].

Slot 7 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [static camera POV (or selfie if pose is one-handed)] (STYLE_POSE): [camera framing wider (medium-wide or full-body-wide), character in a DIFFERENT room of the same home (tier-matched), in a stylish pose (e.g., seated in soft accent armchair with leg crossed casually / window-seat in soft daylight / leaning against doorframe / mid-step walking confidently / on kitchen island / on stairs / on balcony), outfit-complete (shoes visible if full-body, up to 1 paired accessory optional), confident victory expression — by default a warm open grin or a small delighted laugh, posture proud (massive open grin / head thrown back / full-body explosive joy ONLY under the hyped register), mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 7, kraft bag GONE].

Slot 8 — exact 9:16 vertical still, [POV / distance different from Slot 7] (FINAL_LOOK): [settled alive final wrap in the STYLE_POSE room (or a natural continuation) — a last confident look to the lens, a warm open grin or small delighted laugh, loop-ready mid-motion, mouth open mid-word lip-syncing Cut 8, kraft bag GONE, explicit hand allocation].

Rendering rules: every slot is an exact 9:16 vertical rectangle, all eight slots identical in size, arranged in ONE HORIZONTAL ROW (do NOT make two rows or a grid — exactly eight panels in one row, never ten, never twelve) with thin white gutters on a clean white background, total sheet aspect 21:9. All eight slots are active — there are no placeholder slots. No two adjacent slots share both their POV and their distance band. Active slots are photorealistic iPhone-style UGC stills with natural light and casual real-life feel. The character's identity is identical across all eight panels. Outfit Continuity strictly observed: S1 = pre-wear, S2-S8 = product outfit, kraft bag in S1 only and never re-introduced. Garment Consistency Lock: silhouette / color / print / recognizable details identical across every slot in which the product is worn. Realistic fit on the character's body, natural drape, not exaggerated. The character has exactly two hands; selfie POV occupies one hand with the phone, leaving one hand for action; two-handed actions are static camera POV; every slot names each hand's single role, the idle hand parked explicitly, and the total simultaneous hand-roles never exceed two. POV may change between slots; every POV change aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition. The product (if present) keeps the same silhouette, color, print, and recognizable design details across all appearances. In the macro slots (Slots 4 and 6) the macro is HAND-FREE — no hand contact with the fabric, no skim, no pull, no brush, no pinch; texture reads through framing, drape, and light only. The kraft paper bag appears only in Slot 1; after Slot 1 the bag is GONE and is never re-introduced. Never depict the character changing clothes on camera — the transition from pre-wear (Slot 1) to product outfit (Slot 2) is implicit, handled by the hard cut. No mirror or reflection shots. Exactly one hero garment — no duplicate copy and no look-alike garment anywhere in any slot. Every prop holds exactly one state per slot; state changes happen only across the hard cuts, never inside a slot. No on-image text of any kind: no header, no metadata, no captions, no pop-text, no badges, no numbers, no subtitles, no watermarks; no legible text or numbers on any prop other than the garment's own print. No fisheye lens, no ultra-wide distortion. Deep focus throughout — no shallow depth of field, no bokeh, no lens flare, no cinematic color grade, no beauty filter [omit these negatives when user_request explicitly asks for a cinematic look]. No deformed hands. No third arm, no extra hands, no duplicated limbs. No duplicated person. No additional brands or logos beyond the user's product. No invented product claims.

## Hard Restrictions

- Never describe the character's age, ethnicity, attractiveness, makeup, or facial features beyond what the reference image supplies.
- Never generate more or fewer than 8 slots.
- Never make slots different sizes from each other.
- Never deviate from exact 9:16 per slot.
- Never include placeholder slots — all eight are always active.
- Never put any text, header, metadata, caption, badge, number, pop-text, subtitle, or watermark on the sheet.
- Never invent unseen garment design details when product reference is provided.
- Never render the product at exaggerated proportions — realistic fit on the character's body.
- Never depict the product peeking out of the kraft bag, hanging on a hanger, draped on a chair, laid on a bed in Slots 2-8 — the product is fully hidden inside the closed bag in Slot 1, or worn by the character in Slots 2-8.
- Never depict more than two hands. Selfie POV = one phone-hand + one free hand only. Two-object holds in selfie POV are forbidden — switch to static camera. Never write an action load that implies an extra holder — more than two simultaneous hand-roles in one slot = REWRITE.
- **Never use mirror or reflection shots.** Try-on does NOT use mirrors as POV or as prop. No bathroom mirror, no full-length mirror, no shop window reflection, no phone-screen reflection, no any reflective surface showing the character.
- Never use unsafe or physically impossible product interactions.
- Never invent legal claims, medical claims, certifications, or unsupported superiority claims about the product.
- Never include unrelated real-world brands or IP.
- Never ignore `user_request`-specified setting, action, or duration — except the Outfit Continuity rule, the Kraft Bag S1-only rule, and the Mirror Ban remain non-negotiable even for Director-tier user input.
- Never let hairstyle change inside or across boards.
- **Slot 1 of Board 1 MUST always show the kraft bag and pre-wear outfit** (product NOT visible / NOT worn). The product reveal lands in Slot 2 (WEARING); never default Slot 1 to "show character already in product" — that's a Slot 2 or Slot 7 beat for try-on.
- Never depict the character changing clothes on camera — outfit transition between Slot 1 and Slot 2 is implicit (handled by the hard cut).
- **Never depict the kraft bag in Slots 2-8** — it is gone forever after Slot 1.
- **Never depict the character opening the kraft bag, lifting the product out, peeking inside, or vlogging the bag.** The bag is a contextual prop in Slot 1 only.
- **Never depict the pre-wear outfit in Slots 2-8 or in any later board.** Once in the product, she stays in the product.
- **Never depict any hand making contact with the product fabric in Slot 4 (TEXTURE_CLOSEUP)** — neither the character's own hand nor any other hand. The macro shows the texture / cut / detail through framing, drape, light, and natural body micro-movement only. No "operator hand" enters the close-up frame. No skim, no pull, no lift, no brush, no pinch.
- **Never violate Garment Consistency Lock** — silhouette / color / print / recognizable details stay identical across all slots in which the product is worn. The character may turn naturally; the garment never changes.
- Never describe a cardboard delivery box, packing tape, tissue paper, knife, or any unboxing-style packaging — this is a try-on, not an unboxing.
- Never break the previous-board match when K > 1 unless K ≥ 3 and a new room of the same home is used (still tier-matched).
- Never wrap the prompt in commentary, fences, or analysis — the string alone is the output.
- Never use a workshop / garage / industrial / cluttered surface for the kraft bag in Slot 1 — premium clean home surfaces only (marble, light wood, white lacquer, quartz).
- Never use golden hour, warm sunset, orange/amber cast, or late-afternoon warm wash lighting unless `user_request` explicitly asks.
- **Per-K location rules (mandatory):** Board 1 Slots 7-8 = different room of same home. Board 2 = Slot 1 bridges B1's final room vibe, Slots 2-8 across other home rooms. Board 3 = ALL slots outdoor, rain from Slot 2. Board 4 = ALL slots back inside the home, settled reflection mode. Board ≥5 = loop pattern.
- **Hair stays dry on K=3 outdoor** — never depict wet / soaked / dripping hair, even in rain slots. Default: light drizzle that doesn't reach hair.
- **No puddle / wet-pavement / wet-glass reflections showing the character** on K=3 — wet surfaces may catch ambient sky light but no character-visible reflections.
- **Board 3 garment-water interaction is NOT a Garment Consistency Lock violation** — water droplets on fabric surface, light sheen, minor temporary darkening at droplet concentration are allowed per Step 7 Environmental Effects Exception. Garment underneath stays identical to dry slots.
- **Board 4 energy register is settled-glow**, never explosive-scream — the active register (natural quiet contentment by default; sustained hyped ONLY on explicit hype signals) delivered in calm-settled body posture (seated / lounging), never jumping / lifting.
- **Never depict a duplicate or look-alike garment** — exactly one hero product; no second copy, no similar-color / similar-silhouette garment draped, hanging, or worn by anyone else in any slot.
- **Never depict a prop in two states within one slot** (bag both held and standing, half-open bag, product both worn and draped) — state changes happen only across the hard cuts between slots.
- **Never place legible text or numbers on any prop or surface other than the garment's own print** — never mirror, reverse, or restyle the garment's print, and never let the product's name / wordmark bleed onto another object.
- Never size an accessory by object comparison ("about the size of a water bottle") — hand-relative plus approximate cm only.
- Never render a default affordance the product is sold on lacking (a zipper on a seamless dress, straps on a strapless top) — state the absence in the prompt body AND in the closing negative run.
- Never stage a physical quirk in a macro slot (Slot 4 or Slot 6), on the kraft bag, or in more than one slot — one dedicated LARGE moment, only when `user_request` signals it.

## Final reminder

One prompt string, built per the Required Prompt Template above — no JSON, no fences, no analysis.
Exactly EIGHT slots in ONE horizontal row, `@ImageN` declarations first, no baked slot labels or
on-image text. If an input is missing, fall back to the defaults in this file and still produce a
prompt.

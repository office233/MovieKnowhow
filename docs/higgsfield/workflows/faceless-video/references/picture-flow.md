# picture-flow.md — STILL PICTURES mode (narrated stills)

**This is a MOTION MODE, not a channel and not a style.** It is chosen in intake Round 1b
("Animated" vs "Still pictures", `motion_mode: stills`) and works with EVERY channel type
and EVERY preset in the catalog. The old direction card **"Frame by frame"**
(`bc3c6f53-762e-4806-84f0-37a85e278835`) is HIDDEN and must never be offered; if a legacy
run carries that id, read it as `motion_mode: stills` + the Flat 2D Papercraft look.

**Canonical style-donor ref — ALWAYS attach it to the style-key call** (Phase 1 RULE 0):
`media_import_url` this URL and pass the returned `media_id` as `image_references`,
together with the picked preset's own CMS `images[]` / resolved `media_id` — including when
the mode auto-locked from the prompt instead of a card pick. On a stills run in some other
preset (Editorial stills, Studio 3D stills…), that preset's donors come first and this ref
is optional: it carries the papercraft look, so attach it only when the locked style IS
Flat 2D Papercraft.

The ref is a style DONOR only: take the render style, palette and paper treatment, never
its specific subjects or composition.

The video is
built from STILL IMAGES, not motion clips — a narrated storybook where every
spoken beat gets its own picture and **each picture stays on screen exactly as
long as its line takes to say** (the assembler reads the audio durations; no
fixed 10s windows here). Tone belongs to the CHANNEL, not to this file: stills can be a
kids bedtime tale, a history vignette, a deadpan explainer — the mode is the
MECHANIC, not the audience.

Models stay locked: images `seedream_v5_pro`, voice `seed_audio`. NO
`minimax_h3` in this mode — nothing is animated.

**An explicit stills ask in the prompt** ("picture story / stills / slideshow /
storybook video / one image per line") locks `motion_mode: stills` from the prompt and
skips Round 1b. The channel type and the style stay whatever they were — never "correct"
a stills run back to motion, and never swap the user's preset for a stills-specific one.

## Styles — the picked preset wins; these are the DEFAULTS when nothing was picked

1. **Flat 2D Papercraft (recommended)** — "Layered cut-paper collage — flat
   colored paper shapes with crisp cut edges, subtle drop shadows between
   layers, textured construction paper." This is the look the pipeline is tuned
   for, so it is the default whenever a stills run has no preset of its own.

   FORMULA (§0 form, byte-identical everywhere):

   > flat 2D papercraft collage: characters and scenery cut from colored
   > construction paper with crisp scissor-cut edges, layered flat shapes
   > with subtle soft drop shadows between paper layers, visible paper grain
   > and fiber texture, slightly imperfect hand-cut silhouettes, matte
   > saturated paper palette, simple readable compositions on a plain paper
   > backdrop, handcrafted collage feel, non-photorealistic, no gradients
   > outside paper shadows, no outlines — shapes are defined by paper edges.

   PALETTE LOCK: `matte construction-paper palette of the reference images —
no neon, no gradients, colors read as physical paper`.

2. **Stickman Cartoon** — the generic webcomic formula from
   `references/prompts.md §0` (crude paint-program webcomic), verbatim.

3. **Hand-drawn Ink** — the formula from `references/kids-styles.md §4`
   (thin-line ink on pure white, greyscale), verbatim.

Something adjacent the user asks for ("crayon", "flat vector") → map to the
closest of the three and confirm in one line; uploads work as style donors as
usual.

## FRAME-BY-FRAME, not a slideshow (this direction's core)

The audio is ONE continuous narration of the whole story (Phase 5) — NEVER
2–3s per-beat snippets. Whisper then gives word timestamps, and FRAMES are
laid onto that timeline (Phase 5b/4/6). The point is animation-by-stills: a
single moment gets a SMALL BURST of near-identical frames that each change ONE
detail, so it reads as movement — not one static picture held while the
narrator talks.

**The mental model — a moment = a burst of edited frames of the SAME shot:**

> "woke up, on his back" → F1 WIDE: John flat on his back, eyes closed.
> (same shot) → F2: eyes OPEN. (same shot) → F3: head turned, squinting.
> "his face — a scowl" → F4 CLOSE-UP: John's face neutral.
> (same shot) → F5: brows knit, scowl lands.
> "he sat up on the bed" → F6 MEDIUM: sitting up, mid-rise.
> "shuffled down the hall" → F7: walking the hallway.
> (same shot) → F8: still walking, scratching his head.
> "brushing his teeth" → F9 INTERIOR: brush AT his mouth.
> (same shot) → F10: hand DOWN, done, foam on lip.

Every arrow is ONE image. Notice most moments are 2–3 frames of the SAME
composition with one change (eyes, brow, hand position) — THAT is the
frame-by-frame feel. A brand-new framing happens when the ACTION or PLACE
changes (bed → face → hall → bathroom), not on every frame.

- **A new SHOT (new framing) whenever the line changes** action, place or
  subject; WITHIN a shot, 2–3 micro-variation frames carry the little
  movement (open eyes, turn head, raise hand).
- **SHOT MIX (the cut rhythm):** each frame names its SHOT — WIDE / MEDIUM /
  CLOSE-UP — mixed RANDOMLY with exactly one hard ban: **two CLOSE-UPs never
  run back to back.** Everything else may repeat (WIDE WIDE is legal, MEDIUM
  MEDIUM is legal): a healthy run reads like
  `W M W C W W M C W`. The CLOSE-UP → MEDIUM handoff is the money transition —
  show the emotion close, then play the resulting movement on the medium.
  (A micro-variation frame keeps its base's shot size — that's the one legal
  same-framing repeat, and it still counts as a CU for the no-two-CUs rule.)
- **Frame cadence — a frame every ~0.7–1.2s.** Once Whisper gives the
  timeline, slice it so NO frame holds longer than 1.5s (the assembler's hard
  cap). A phrase that spans 2s = 2 frames; 3s = 3 frames — usually the
  base plus its micro-variations. The picture changes about twice per spoken
  beat; a frame lingering while the narrator keeps talking is the slideshow we
  are killing.
- **THE MICRO-VARIATION FRAME (the whole trick) — it is an EDIT, not a
  re-render:** most frames ARE the previous frame with ONE detail changed.
  Generate it by passing the previous rendered frame's job_id as the **ONLY**
  reference — **do NOT attach the character sheet, location or props** (those
  make the model rebuild the scene, producing a different picture instead of an
  edit). Prompt: "Take the reference image and keep it EXACTLY — same
  composition, crop, camera, character, colors, background, style. Change ONLY:
  {one detail — eyebrows knit / eyes open / hand lowers / foam appears}. Do not
  redraw anything else." A run of 2–4 such edits chained on ONE shot IS the
  animation; a genuinely new framing (from assets) only when the action or
  place changes. See Phase 4 for the KIND-A/KIND-B split.
- **Frame count is a HARD FLOOR, not a suggestion: at least one frame every
  ~1.5s of narration, target one every ~1s.** A 1-minute story = **45–70
  FRAMES** (never fewer than ~40); 2 minutes = 90–140. Plan the count from the
  target duration BEFORE generating and show it at SCRIPT LOCK. **The assembler
  REJECTS a run with fewer than `ceil(narration_sec / 1.5)` frames** (a 60s
  story with 15 frames is a slideshow and hard-fails) — so generate the full
  dense set up front, don't discover the shortfall at assembly.
- **Why this is cheap: about half the frames are edits** — the previous frame
  with ONE visible thing moved (one ref image + one `change_only` line). A single
  spoken moment ("he woke up") is not one frame, it is a BURST: on his back →
  eyes open → head turns → sits up. Budget ~2–3 frames per spoken beat; if a
  beat has only one frame, you are under-generating. But a burst is at most
  ONE new framing plus TWO edits — the next beat gets its own framing.
- **SHOW WHAT THE LINE NAMES** (the variety law applies): the frame's nouns
  are IN the picture.
- Characters recur across frames (John in every frame) — identity comes from
  the asset roster refs + the previous-frame ref, same as the video flow.

## Pipeline deltas (vs the video flow)

Phases keep their numbers; what changes:

- **Phase 2 — assets (MANDATORY, FIRST — frames are composed FROM them):**
  characters (2:3) + key locations (chosen aspect) + props (1:1), style
  formula byte-identical, ≤7 refs per image call. Assets are REFERENCES
  ONLY — an asset sheet NEVER appears in the final as a slide (the assembler
  hard-fails on any wrong-aspect image). Locations are cheap here — a beat
  reuses its location REF with a different composition, never the same
  rendered frame.
- **Phase 3 — script = ONE continuous narration + a shot outline.** Write the
  whole story as flowing narration (the text the singer/narrator will actually
  read end to end), PLUS a shot outline naming the framings in order
  (bed-wide → face-CU → hall-medium → bathroom) and, per framing, which
  micro-variation frames it will spawn (eyes open, brow knits, hand lowers).
  SCRIPT LOCK shows the narration + the outline + the estimated FRAME count.
- **Phase 5 — voice FIRST, ONE CONTINUOUS TRACK (not per-beat):** submit the
  narration through `generate_audio_batch` as one indexed `seed_audio` item (or stable
  indexed chunks when it exceeds the prompt limit), with the locked voice pair, read
  straight through — NEVER 2–3s snippets per phrase (that was the old bug).
  Long stories exceed the 2048-char prompt limit → split into a FEW LARGE
  chunks (whole paragraphs, ~1800 chars each, same voice pair + same
  {DELIVERY} verbatim) and losslessly join them into ONE `narration.wav`
  (`ffmpeg -f concat -c copy` — legal input prep). One flowing read, natural
  pacing; regenerate a chunk on wrong timbre or garbled reads. Every audio call
  is numbered `narration-chunk-NNN` in `work/manifest.json` in spoken order (a
  one-call read is `narration-chunk-001`); a retry reuses that number instead of
  adding a variant, and the per-line budget in the loaded `narrator` workflow applies.
- **Phase 5b — Whisper the narration → the NUMBERED FRAME TIMELINE.** Run
  `${HF_WORKFLOWS}/faceless-video/scripts/audio_to_captions.py narration.wav
  --json words.json`, then run the deterministic builder:
  ```
  python3 ${HF_WORKFLOWS}/faceless-video/scripts/build_scene_timeline.py \
    --script script_manifest.json --timestamps words.json \
    --audio-duration {MEASURED_AUDIO_SECONDS} \
    --requested-duration {REQUESTED_SECONDS} --out scene_manifest.json
  ```
  The builder aligns authored beats to Whisper words, creates contiguous
  ~0.7–1.2s segments capped at 1.5s, numbers them in spoken order, and emits
  dependency waves. It is the only production segment builder; never estimate or
  evenly spread timestamps.
  **A FRAME'S DURATION IS ARITHMETIC, NEVER AN ESTIMATE:
  `duration(n) = start(n+1) - start(n)`**, both starts straight from Whisper, and
  the last frame runs to the end of the audio. Keep each frame's START in the
  ledger too. Measured on dev 2026-07-29 (S10): guessed or evenly-spread durations
  make the pictures drift AHEAD of the words — by mid-video you are looking at a
  frame belonging to a sentence that has not been spoken yet. The assembler now
  rejects a manifest whose durations miss the narration length by more than 0.6s,
  and before assembly you spot-check three frames at ~25% / 50% / 75%: the frame
  at that timestamp must show what is being said at that timestamp.
- **Phase 4 — images AFTER the timeline exists. TWO frame kinds, and MOST are
  EDITS (this is the whole point — read carefully):**

  **KIND A — NEW-FRAMING frame (`image_mode:"new"`):** a fresh `seedream_v5_pro`
  render composed FROM the Phase-2 assets. `medias` = the segment's location →
  character sheet(s) → props (role `image_references`); prompt = the SHOT +
  scene in THIS EXACT style {FORMULA}. Use this ONLY when the ACTION or PLACE
  changes (bed → face → hallway → sink). These are the MINORITY — roughly one
  per real scene change.

  **KIND B — EDIT / micro-variation frame (`image_mode:"variation"`) — ABOUT HALF
  the frames, never more than TWO IN A ROW:** DO NOT re-render from assets. Take the
  PREVIOUS rendered frame's job_id and pass it as the **ONE and ONLY**
  reference on the call — **NO asset sheets, NO location, NO props** (adding
  them makes the model rebuild the scene from scratch — the exact bug that
  yields different pictures instead of an edit). Prompt VERBATIM shape:
  > "Take the reference image and keep it EXACTLY: same composition, same crop,
  > same camera, same character, same colors, same background, same style.
  > Change ONLY: {one small detail — eyes open / brows knit / hand lowers /
  > mouth opens / foam appears}. Do not redraw or re-stage anything else."
  The result is the previous frame with ONE thing moved — THAT is the
  animation. **THE CHAIN IS CAPPED AT TWO: KIND A once, then AT MOST 2 KIND-B
  edits (three frames, ~3 seconds), then a NEW KIND-A framing.** Measured on dev
  2026-07-29 (S7/S8): longer chains give exactly the complaint "I am looking at
  one picture for five seconds and it just gets edited" — the eye reads a chain of
  small tweaks as a still image with glitches, not as movement. Raise density by
  generating MORE NEW FRAMINGS and editing those, never by extending a chain.
  **And the one change must be VISIBLE AT A GLANCE** — a hand or arm moves, the
  head turns, the mouth opens, the body shifts, an object enters or leaves. A
  single eyebrow or a colour tweak is invisible in one second of screen time and
  wastes the frame. **If two consecutive frames look like different photos of the
  same moment, KIND B was done wrong** — assets were sent and the scene got
  re-rendered instead of the previous frame edited.

  Both kinds: `aspect_ratio` = the CHOSEN aspect (never square/2:3/1:1 — the
  assembler rejects wrong-aspect), 1080p-class not 2k/2.7k, no in-frame text.
  Execute the manifest's `generation_waves` in order: all independent KIND-A
  frames in wave 0, first edits in wave 1, second edits in wave 2. Use each frame
  number as its batch `index`, submit chunks of at most 12, wait with `jobs_wait`,
  then show the completed exact frame ids with
  `show_generation_by_ids` (chunks of 60). **Generate the FULL dense set to clear the
  assembler floor (`ceil(narration_sec/1.5)`, ~40 for a minute), with roughly
  HALF KIND-A and half KIND-B.** The rhythm is a PAIR OR TRIPLET, not a run of
  either: **a new framing then one or two edits of it, then the next new framing.
  Never more than two edits in a row — and never more than two NEW FRAMINGS in a
  row either.** Both failure modes were measured on dev 2026-07-29 and both are
  bugs: mostly-KIND-B gave "five seconds of one picture being edited" (S7/S8), and
  then mostly-KIND-A gave "too many new frames, you cannot tell what is happening"
  (U18). A new framing changes the CAMERA on the same place — the LOCATION only
  changes when the narration goes somewhere else. Never pad holds to reach the
  count.
  - **PROVENANCE — STRICT:** save generation and wait JSON, bind completed
    indexed results to deterministic slots with `bind_scene_frame_results.py`,
    then atomically restore the complete set with
    `materialize_scene_frames.py --manifest scene_manifest.bound.json
    --frames-dir work/frames`. The binder verifies variation lineage and the
    materializer fails closed on missing/truncated frames. Never copy a neighbour
    into a gap or name by completion order.
  - **READ THE ORDER BACK BEFORE ASSEMBLY.** Measured on dev 2026-07-29: a stills
    run shipped with the frames out of story order — beautiful pictures telling
    the wrong sequence. The numbers passing the script's ascending check is not
    the same as the PICTURES matching the words. So before Phase 6, print the
    ledger as `NNN → the beat's first five words` and read it top to bottom: does
    the story move forward? Then spot-check three frames against their beat text
    (open the image, read the line). A frame that illustrates a different beat is
    renamed/regenerated now — after assembly it costs the whole cut.
- **Phase 6 — `${HF_WORKFLOWS}/faceless-video/scripts/assemble_slides.sh
  --audio narration.wav --blocks N --timeline scene_manifest.bound.json
  --frames-dir work/frames --requested-seconds REQUESTED_SECONDS`** (NOT
  assemble_final.sh): the ONE continuous narration is laid over the whole cut;
  the bound manifest carries Whisper timings and actual job provenance.
  `--blocks N` is the frame count. The script asserts manifest v2, count,
  contiguous timestamps, variation lineage, strictly ascending frame numbers,
  per-frame
  ASPECT (a wrong-aspect image = an asset leaked into the frames = hard fail),
  **MAX HOLD — no frame longer than 1.5s**, duration agreement, distinct-image
  content floor, 1080p-class cap,
  the narration is present (not silent), full decode, and the LEVEL LAW (narration 1.0; optional music bed
  0.10 generic / 0.05 kids, DUCKED under the voice; NO clip SFX in this
  direction — a quiet bed is RECOMMENDED: kids-tone stories follow the Kids
  default-bed rule, others take a user file or explicit ask; never blocking).
- **Phase 7 — subtitles:** invoke the **`subtitles` skill** on the assembled cut
  (pass `script_manifest.json` as the authored wording; look = `clean` by
  default, `paper` for storybook tones). Never hand-time or hand-burn captions;
  if the skill reports Whisper unavailable, deliver unsubbed and say so.
- **Phase 8 — no automatic upscale:** deliver the validated cut first; only an explicit
  request or accepted post-delivery offer runs the optional Topaz path in `SKILL.md`.

## What does NOT apply here

10s windows, 3/4-cut templates, {MOTION} tokens, freeze/tail probes, H3
retry specifics, impact beats. Everything else (golden rules on models,
voice lock, palette lock, no on-screen text, scripts-only assembly, no
invented progress) applies in full.

Project workspace scaffolded $(date '+%Y-%m-%d') by \`scripts/new-project.sh\`.

## Get started

1. **Rename the placeholder bibles.** Currently you have:
   - \`character-bible-CHARACTER.md\` — rename to \`character-bible-<your-character-working-name>.md\` (one file per recurring character, copy this stub for each)
   - \`environment-bible-LOCATION.md\` — rename to \`environment-bible-<your-location-working-name>.md\` (one file per recurring location)
2. **Open this folder** in Claude Code, or open claude.ai with the four skills installed.
3. **Tell the orchestrator:** *"Working on $PROJECT_NAME"* (or just describe what you're making — \`ai-film-director\` will pick up from there).

## Folder map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| \`character-bible-*.md\` | Per-character locked spec (visual descriptor, looks, prompts used, reference filenames) |
| \`environment-bible-*.md\` | Per-location locked spec (description, lighting, set dressing, plate filename, prompt used) |
| \`prop-bible.md\` | Shared file with one entry per hero prop/creature/vehicle |
| \`shot-list.md\` | The film mapped beat by beat — every shot's runtime, mode, characters, references, what-happens, connects-from/to |
| \`generation-log.md\` | Every generation attempt — prompt, refs, result, kept/wasted, credits, why |
| \`suno-music-prompt.md\` | Suno music style + lyric template (filled in during Phase 6) |
| \`title-card-prompt.md\` | Title card creative brief for banana-pro-director (filled in during Phase 6 if title needed) |
| \`references/characters/<name>/\` | Locked character sheets and look variants |
| \`references/environments/<location>/\` | Locked environment plates and alternate angles |
| \`references/props/<name>/\` | Locked prop sheets (vehicle, creature, hero object) |
| \`references/titles/\` | Title card images if generated |
| \`clips/\` | Generated Seedance video clips |
| \`audio/\` | Suno track + diegetic SFX from libraries |
| \`prompts/\` | Saved prompt text per shot (optional, for traceability) |
| \`qc-reports/\` | Saved video-qa reports for this project |

## What's gitignored

This entire \`projects/$PROJECT_NAME/\` folder is gitignored by default. Project content (bibles, references, clips) is personal — it doesn't get committed to the public repo. If you ever want to share a project as an example, add it explicitly to git with \`git add -f\`.

## Notes for this project

(Replace this section with anything project-specific you want to remember — client, deadline, deliverable specs, etc.)

## Inspiration

If you want to see what's possible with this skill set, check out **CTRL** — an AI-generated K-Pop group created by Joey (@acornjoey), a director in NYC. The two specialist skills in this repo are built on top of his original work; CTRL was the production they came out of.

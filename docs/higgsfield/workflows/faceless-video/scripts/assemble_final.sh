#!/usr/bin/env bash
# assemble_final.sh — ONE command that turns block clips + per-block voice lines into
# ONE finished video. Deterministic, weak-agent-proof: the agent calls this once and
# never hand-rolls ffmpeg. Guarantees:
#   * fixed length  = N × clip-seconds (default 10) — video is NEVER shortened to audio
#     (asserted on the output; the script FAILS if the final duration is off by > 1s)
#   * one file out   (never part1/part2)
#   * NO time-stretch (no atempo / no speed change) — a voice line whose SPEECH is
#     longer than the window is a HARD ERROR (rewrite + regenerate upstream)
#   * a clip shorter than the window by > 0.5s is a HARD ERROR (regenerate the block)
#   * each block's voice is centered by its SPEECH, not by file length: leading and
#     trailing silence in the TTS file is measured (silencedetect) and ignored, so a
#     padded take can't shift the words off their scene
#   * pair sanity: if the numbers in a clip filename and its voice filename disagree
#     (block03 + voice05), you get a WARNING — the #1 cause of "audio on the wrong block"
#   * NO leading freeze (first ~1.5s checked with freezedetect) and no long frozen
#     TAIL (last ~2s checked) — a WARNING means regenerate that block
#   * LEVEL LAW — voice 1.0 always; the clips' own diegetic SFX are KEPT under
#     the voice at 0.12 (--sfx-vol, clamped <=0.20); the optional music bed sits
#     at 0.10 (--music-vol, clamped <=0.20); final loudnorm -16 LUFS
#   * --sfx-vol 0 excludes clip audio entirely (voice/song is kept)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/assemble_final.sh --out final.mp4 --blocks N [--clip-seconds 10]
#       [--music bed.mp3] [--music-vol 0.10] [--sfx-vol 0.12] [--manifest pairs.txt]
#       [--allow-mismatch]
#       [block01.mp4 voice01.wav block02.mp4 voice02.wav ...]
#
# Pass clip/voice PAIRS in block order — positionally, or (preferred, always in
# production) via --manifest: one "clip voice" pair per line, # comments allowed.
# --blocks N is REQUIRED on every run: the pair count is asserted BEFORE any
# work, so a dropped pair fails instead of shipping a hole. Pair-number
# mismatches (block03 + voice05) are an ERROR (--allow-mismatch to override
# for truly unnumbered files).
# Subtitles are NOT burned here — that is the `video-subtitler` skill, run AFTER assembly
# on the clean voice takes + this script's sidecar. Captions are NEVER
# hand-timed by an agent.
# --song song.wav = SONG MODE (kids music video): args/manifest lines are
# CLIPS ONLY (one per block, no voice files); the one continuous sung track
# is laid over the whole cut at 1.0, clip SFX drop to 0.06 (unless --sfx-vol
# given); the song length must equal N x clip-seconds within +/-3s (hard
# assert — regenerate the song, never trim). Mutually exclusive with --music.
# Requires: ffmpeg, ffprobe, awk.

  # zone BETWEEN the modes, so even a good 9.0s take was rejected: two dev runs on 2026-07-29
  # spent ~150 generations on 18 lines and then started cutting silence inside the takes to
  # pass, which is audible. The band below still brackets the low mode.
  # The ceiling is below CLIP, never CLIP: a take whose speech is as long as the block has zero
  # margin, so the closing consonant lands on the -t CLIP cut and the word is chopped
  # (reproduced 2026-07-31: speech 0.50..10.20 in a 10s block passed the gate and shipped
  # clipped).
  # MOVED 2026-08-01, and the placement is the point. The band used to be CLIP-1.4..CLIP-0.4
  # (8.6-9.6) and it sat in the wrong PLACE: six consecutive takes at the [00:00-00:09] bracket
  # measured 8.58 8.61 8.65 8.69 8.94 8.98, so the old floor ran through the middle of the
  # provider's own distribution and rejected good takes by tens of milliseconds — one run died
  # on 8.580 against 8.600 — while the old ceiling left the closing word 0.05s from the cut on
  # the rare take that reached it. CLIP-0.5 leaves 0.25s of tail after plain centring, which is the deliberate trade:
  # a take between 9.2 and 9.5 is ACCEPTED rather than re-rolled, because a regeneration costs
  # far more than the quarter second it borrows.
  # 2026-08-03: the ceiling now has slack it never uses. The word band came down to 20-23 and
  # the TTS bracket stayed at [00:00-00:09], which lands takes at 8.5-8.9 — measured 8.68 and
  # 8.48 on the pair that fixed the clipping. Length alone should no longer reject anything;
  # if it starts to, the bracket has been widened somewhere and the two must move together.
  # CLIP-2.0 is a floor against
  # a FAILED take, not a pacing rule: 1.5s without narration in a 10s hard-cut block is ordinary
  # editing, and the rate gate — not the length — is what catches a rushed read.
  # 2026-08-04: floor moved from CLIP-2.0 to CLIP-2.2 with the engine swap to elevenlabs,

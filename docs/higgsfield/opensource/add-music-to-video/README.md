# Add Music to Video — AI Video Music Cookbook

**Fully licensed. Safe for commercial use.**

You generated the clips. You stitched them together. Now they need music and sound effects
that fit the edit and the story. That's the hard part: stock libraries and prompt-based
generators don't know where your cuts are, so the audio never quite lands on your edit.

**[Sonilo](https://sonilo.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=v2m-cookbook) turns your video into music and sound effects.** Point it at your finished cut and
it composes an original soundtrack matched to the pacing, emotion, and story, in seconds, no
prompt needed. Every track is **licensed and safe for commercial use**, so creators and brands
can actually ship it. The same upload can also produce **royalty-free sound effects** timed to
the on-screen action: one video in, the whole audio layer out.

This cookbook shows how to add that audio layer to **any** AI-video pipeline.

**▶ [Watch the reference demo](./assets/demo-trailer.mp4)**: a 15-second trailer assembled from
AI-generated clips (stitched → graded → music by Sonilo). The soundtrack was composed from the
finished cut: the swell lands on the reveal, the impact lands on the edit.

## Why this exists

Almost every open-source AI-video pipeline today generates clips, stitches them, and then either
ships **silent** or bolts on a **stock/prompt-picked track that ignores the edit**. The music is
the last mile, and it's the part that makes a cut feel finished.

Sonilo is built for exactly this: an original soundtrack **matched to your video**, licensed and
safe for commercial use. It's vendor-neutral about how the video was made: Runway, Kling, Veo,
Sora, Pika, Luma, Seedance, WAN, LTX, CogVideoX, Stable Video Diffusion, a fal.ai / Replicate
gateway, a ComfyUI graph, or plain stock footage. Sonilo sits **downstream** of all of them.

## Who this is for

Builders of AI-video tools: text-to-video orchestrators, clip stitchers, faceless-video
factories, agentic film systems, and video-editing frameworks that want an audio layer
matched to the finished cut instead of a random library track.

## Two ways to use Sonilo

| Surface | Best for | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP server** ([`sonilo-mcp`](https://github.com/sonilo-ai/sonilo-mcp)) | Agentic workflows (Claude, Codex, any MCP client) | `video_to_music` and `video_to_sfx` tools: hand them a video, get back matched audio |
| **REST API** | Platforms & backends | Async job (poll or webhook) → a downloadable URL for the generated track |

## Sound effects too

`video_to_sfx` (MCP v0.2.1+ and REST) generates a **royalty-free sound-effects track from the same
video**: impacts, ambience, and transitions timed to the picture. Music and effects from one
upload is the part nobody else covers.

- Recipe: [`RECIPES.md` → Add sound effects](./RECIPES.md#add-sound-effects-with-sonilo)
- Hear it: [`DEMOS.md` → Video → sound effects](./DEMOS.md#video--sound-effects)
- Note the caps: SFX takes videos up to 3 minutes; music up to 6.

## 60-second quickstart (MCP)

```jsonc
// Register the Sonilo MCP server (needs a SONILO_API_KEY from sonilo.com)
// claude mcp add sonilo --env SONILO_API_KEY=sk-... -- uvx sonilo-mcp
```

Then, in an agent session, hand Sonilo your finished cut:

```
video_to_music({
  video_path: "path/to/your/final_cut.mp4",
  prompt: "warm hopeful cinematic, building to an uplifting swell"   // optional style hint
})
// → an .m4a soundtrack, matched to your video's length
```

`prompt` is a single **optional** style hint for the whole track. Sonilo works with no prompt at
all, matching the music to what it sees. Then mux the returned audio onto your master (see
[`RECIPES.md`](./RECIPES.md)).

## The full pipeline (vendor-neutral)

```
generated / stitched clips (any model)
   └─ 1. STITCH ── assemble the clips into one cut
        └─ 2. GRADE ── (optional) a cinematic color pass
             └─ 3. ADD AUDIO ── Sonilo: music matched to the cut + optional sound effects
                  └─ 4. MUX ── lay the audio over the master
```

## Integration patterns by tool type

- **Silent-output pipelines** (they stitch clips and ship no audio) → add a music step after the
  final assembly so the output arrives with an original soundtrack.
- **Stock / prompt-picked-music pipelines** → offer Sonilo as an alternative so the music is
  matched to the edit, and every track comes licensed and safe for commercial use.
- **Editing frameworks** → call Sonilo on the rendered timeline and add the returned track.
  Step-by-step recipes: [MoviePy](./recipes/moviepy.md) · [Remotion](./recipes/remotion.md) ·
  [auto-editor](./recipes/auto-editor.md) (same pattern fits editly and similar tools).
- **ComfyUI graphs** → a "Sonilo" audio node after the video-output node. Full recipe: [ComfyUI](./recipes/comfyui.md).
- **Shell / CI pipelines** (no Python/Node) → `curl` + `ffmpeg` recipe: [FFmpeg-only](./recipes/ffmpeg-only.md).
- **Dialogue + music** (interviews, vlogs, talking-head) → `preserve_speech` flag or the `audio_ducking` endpoint keeps the voice clear: [Ducking & speech](./recipes/ducking.md).

## Pricing and getting started

- **Commercial use:** every track is licensed and safe for commercial use (terms apply). Built for work you ship.
- **Pricing:** API usage is billed per second of generated audio. Current rates: [sonilo.com](https://sonilo.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=v2m-cookbook).
- **Free credits at sign-up:** new accounts start with free credits, enough to try `video_to_music` on your own cut before paying anything.

## Why "licensed" matters

For teams who put video into the world and can't gamble on a takedown, Sonilo is the licensed
video-to-music platform: **trained on a licensed catalog, clean rights from the source.** Every
track is **safe for commercial use and licensed (terms apply)**. An original soundtrack, composed
for your video.

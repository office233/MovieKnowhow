# Mode: hero-banner

Wide-format banner images for website headers, landing pages, email campaigns, and section dividers. Cinematic composition, strong focal anchor, brand-aligned mood.

## Why hero banners are their own genre

A hero banner must:
- Have a strong focal anchor and clear visual hierarchy
- Survive being cropped — works at multiple aspect ratios
- Convey brand mood in under one second
- Feel cinematic and editorial, not generic stock

## Banner Presets

## Composition rules

- Strong focal anchor at one of two strong vertical thirds, not dead center
- Lighting and lines lead the eye through the composition
- Foreground depth element adds richness (out-of-focus leaf, surface texture, fabric edge)
- Crop safety — keep critical subject inside the central safe zone for mobile
- Rich tonal range — banners should feel cinematic, not flat

## Lighting by brand tier

- **Premium / luxury**: hard rim light against deep shadow, single dominant source
- **Approachable / DTC**: soft window light, warm ambient, low contrast
- **Energetic / bold**: strong directional, saturated color, dramatic shadows
- **Calm / wellness**: diffused overcast, even tones, atmospheric haze
- **Editorial / fashion**: golden hour, anamorphic flare, cinematic depth

## Quality gates

- [ ] Wide aspect ratio appropriate for use case

## Generation invocation

Follow the runtime orchestration in `SKILL.md`. Use `16:9` unless the brief
explicitly calls for an ultra-wide banner, then use `21:9`.

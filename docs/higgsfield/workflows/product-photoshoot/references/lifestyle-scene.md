## Composition rules

- Product is the focal anchor even when small in frame — use light, color, or DoF to draw the eye
- Surrounding objects suggest a story, not random clutter
- Negative space is intentional and feels lived-in
- Avoid perfect symmetry — natural lifestyle has asymmetry
- Hands shown? Specify finger positions and natural skin texture

## Quality gates

- [ ] Product is the visual anchor of the scene
- [ ] Lighting has clear motivated source
- [ ] Hands / people (if present) look natural, anatomy correct
- [ ] Surrounding objects support a coherent story
- [ ] Color palette aligns with known brand context
- [ ] No uncanny artifacts or warping
- [ ] Atmosphere feels intentional

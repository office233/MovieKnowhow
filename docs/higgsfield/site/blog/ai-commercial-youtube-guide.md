David Matamoros, Mar 26, 2026 (companion to YouTube video "A $350,000 AI AD Using Only 1 Tool")  
Prompts extracted: 55

Full prompt log for a heist-style perfume commercial made entirely in **Higgsfield Cinema Studio 2.5** (image keyframes + Cinema Studio Video).
**Characters via Cinema Studio "Cast"** (character-sheet generator) — settings used: Genre Action; Budget $100M (hero) / $50M (woman) — "higher budget" = more polished look; Era 2020s; Archetype Lover; Identity (gender, ethnicity, age); Physique; Eyes; Hair; Facial hair; Outfit via custom prompt (e.g. black tuxedo, James Bond look).
Workflow pattern used throughout:
1. Build **locations once** (mansion lobby, luxury bathroom, vent interior, dark corridor, concrete secret room) and **props** (watch hologram, ID badge, blowgun, dart, perfume) as separate stills.
2. Build **keyframes** by compositing references: "Integrate the guard from Image 1 into Image 2", "Use Image 1 exclusively for appearance, Image 2 only for environment…", camera-angle edits ("Change the camera angle 45 degrees to the right", "slightly change camera angle for 15 degrees to the left").
3. Animate keyframes with short video prompts; name elements with @tags (@Orlando, @Maria, @Orlando_spy_costume, @hologram_img, @watch_img).
4. Use **start + end frames** for controlled transitions (room without lasers -> with lasers; hero reaching for perfume -> Maria's gun).
5. Dialogue lines in quotes with speaker tags; "Static camera" to stop drift.
6. For a CCTV look: generate high-angle fisheye still with scan lines, place tiny character "in a slightly funny pose", animate with a static-camera prompt, then add lens/scanline effects in DaVinci.
7. Ending: product in sharp foreground, couple kissing blurred behind -> one simple video prompt.

## Prompts (verbatim)

### P1. Location: Gatsby-style mansion lobby
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: location

```text
Gatsby‑style mansion lobby, grand twin staircases and glossy marble floor under warm golden lights, an elegant yet slightly ominous atmosphere of a secret late‑night rendezvous.
```

### P2. Keyframe: couple with champagne at cocktail table
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: keyframe with Cast characters

```text
PA couple, standing, facing each other, but not too close, near them is a small cocktail table, each holding a champagne flute, engaged in close conversation, they are smiling just enough to be kind to each other, just slightly flirting, not laughing. Cocktail table with two champagne flutes standing in the foreground of the left edge of the image, blurred. The setting is inspired by the reference location but not used as a direct background — the environment is reconstructed and reinterpreted, maintaining the same atmosphere and style. The space is dressed for a formal evening event — round cocktail tables scattered across the room, elegantly dressed guests in business suits and cocktail attire gathered around them. Shallow depth of field — background softly blurred, foreground figures sharp. Lighting is soft and diffused — no harsh shadows, no strong contrast, gentle even illumination across the scene, highlights are not blown out, shadows are lifted and airy. Warm interior light, a sense of occasion. Color graded in warm color, with slight deep green color in the dark areas. Luxury advertising aesthetic — polished, warm tones, aspirational mood.
```

Shot 2: Close-up on <<<image_2>>>; controlled breath, faint smirk that doesn’t reach his eyes, sharp-but-natural rendering, creamy bokeh.

### P7. Location: luxury mansion bathroom
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: location

```text
A bathroom in a luxurious mansion, without a bathtub, without people. Marble walls with a subtle veined pattern, a sculptural sink, a large framed mirror, herringbone stone tiles on the floor, a wall-mounted toilet with a concealed cistern, a built-in niche with minimalist decor, classic wall paneling painted in a deep muted tone, refined, without excessive embellishment.
```

### P8. Reference-driven new original frame
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: 2 references (style/lighting + color grade)

```text
Use the attached image as a reference for style, mood, and lighting, and the second image for color grading and tonal balance. Adjust the composition and camera angle to create a new, original frame — inspired by the references, not copied.

```

### P9. Spy costume character reference sheet
- Use-case: Character / consistency | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: character sheet

```text
A professional character reference sheet on a clean neutral solid background, featuring a clean composition, uniform spacing, and perfect consistency across all panels. On the left — a medium shot of the character framed from the waist up, facing forward. On the right — two full-body standing views of the same character, arranged as a front view and a back view. No text, no labels, no background elements other than the plain neutral backdrop. The image preserves the original warm, slightly muted cinematic color grade with rich brown and olive undertones, balanced exposure, and deep shadows. Fine cinematic film grain is preserved, maintaining a natural filmic realism. Soft frontal and top-left directional lighting creates gentle highlights and soft v defining shadows. The subject is a man with olive skin, a sharp angular jawline, high cheekbones, dark wavy short hair, a thin mustache, and brown eyes, maintaining the exact face, hair, body proportions, and pose. He is dressed in a functional stealth infiltration outfit designed for navigating ventilation shafts and tight maintenance spaces: a matte black close-fitting tactical suit made of low-noise technical fabric, with articulated panels at the shoulders, elbows, and knees. The outfit includes slim reinforced gloves with tactile fingertips, lightweight harness straps across the torso, and compact utility modules along the belt line. The materials are matte, non-reflective, and practical, featuring subtle advanced espionage detailing that naturally absorbs the warm directional light and fits cohesively within the established cinematic grade. preserve original color grade, preserve original grain, preserve original exposure, preserve original framing, no beauty grade, no skin smoothing, no sharpening, no HDR, no contrast push, no saturation boost, photorealistic, this is a film frame not an advertisement.

```text
Profile shot of a man from the left side. He is standing with his back to a mirror (the mirror is positioned on the left side of the frame, but not visible). His hand is raised, and he is looking at his watch, above which a hologram is visible (reference: @hologram_img). Use the second image as (bathroom_img) a reference for the room design, but do not show the mirror or the door — instead, show the opposite wall of the room. The background is heavily blurred, with focus only on the subject. Shot on a 75mm lens.
```

### P15. Room seen from inside the ventilation
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: POV from inside vent

```text
Imagine how the room from the first image would look from inside the ventilation. The camera is placed inside the vent, looking through the vent grille.

### P18. POV from inside shaft — gloved hands grip grate
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: POV keyframe

```text
A cinematic POV shot from deep inside a dark industrial metal ventilation shaft, looking toward the rectangular opening covered by an ornate brass and gold decorative grate with diamond lattice and vertical bar pattern. From the other side of the grate — from the warm room beyond — two black tactical-gloved hands grip the bars tightly, fingers curling around the metal rods from outside, pulling the grate toward themselves. We see the backs of the hands pressing against the ornate metalwork, knuckles engaged, tension running through every finger. The hands reach toward us through the lattice pattern, fingers visible between the bars. Only the very top edge of the man's head is barely visible above the grate — a sliver of dark curly hair catching the warm ambient light — his face remains hidden below the frame, crouching low outside. Behind the hands, the luxurious bathroom is completely out of focus — warm golden bokeh of wall sconces, soft marble tones, the ghost of an ornate mirror dissolving into amber blur. The shaft walls surrounding us are cold, rough gunmetal-blue industrial metal. Lighting: warm golden backlight from the room silhouettes the hands against the grate, rim-lighting the glove edges. The hands and grate are the sharpest elements — everything behind them melts into warm blur.
```

### P19. Grille removed
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio Video | Settings: static camera

```text
Static camera. The man grips the ventilation grille, his hands tightening as he removes it cleanly — without bending the bars. The grille falls out of frame.

```text
A man in all-black tactical clothing @Orlando_spy_costume crawls forward through a tight industrial ventilation duct, viewed from a fixed side cross-section camera angle. His body low and tense. Muscles flex under fabric. His head stays down, eyes forward. The metal panels creak and vibrate subtly. Slow, tense, deliberate crawling pace. He makes turns and stops at the grate underneath it on the bottom. A close up.
```

### P22. Location: dark modern corridor
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: location

```text
A long, narrow modern corridor with dark matte walls and a minimalistic design. Clean architectural lines, slightly industrial aesthetic. Soft LED strip lighting runs along the lower edges of both walls, casting a subtle glow across the floor. The corridor leads toward a closed door at the end, partially illuminated by a cool overhead light beam coming from a ceiling opening. Light rays are visible in a slightly hazy atmosphere. Floor is smooth and slightly reflective, with soft light reflections. Walls are dark, desaturated blue-gray tones with minimal texture. Cinematic lighting, low-key exposure, high contrast between shadows and soft highlights. Perspective: centered composition, leading lines guiding toward the door. No people. No clutter. Clean, minimal environment. Ultra-realistic, cinematic still, subtle bloom, soft diffusion, slight film grain.
```

### P23. Security guard character model sheet
- Use-case: Character / consistency | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: 3-panel model sheet

```text
A professional character model sheet arranged horizontally against a clean, blown-out pale solid-color background. The composition consists of three perfectly consistent panels: on the far left, a medium shot framed from the waist up, facing forward; on the right, two full-body standing views arranged side-by-side, featuring a front view and a rear view. The image maintains a bright exposure with lifted shadows and a neutral to slightly cool midtone cast. Fine film grain density is present throughout, establishing an austere, stark atmosphere. Strong overhead directional lighting casts a prominent horizontal highlight across the top of the subject's head, leaving soft but defined shadows under the brow, nose, and strong jawline. The subject is a bald, highly muscular man with a pronounced angular jawline, slightly hollow cheeks, intense piercing blue eyes, and a severe, focused expression in a relaxed standing pose.
He is dressed in a minimalist, prestigious black classic security guard tuxedo, tailored with a fitted single-breasted black jacket with satin lapels, a crisp white shirt, a neat black bow tie, black classic trousers with sharp front creases, and polished black dress shoes. The tuxedo's dark fabric absorbs the bright overhead light, while the satin lapels subtly reflect the cool top-light. A transparent acoustic earpiece rests inside his ear, catching a faint specular highlight, and in his hand he casually holds a matte black pistol. preserve original color grade, preserve original grain, preserve original exposure, preserve original framing, no beauty grade, no skin smoothing, no sharpening, no HDR, no contrast push, no saturation boost, photorealistic, this is a film frame not an advertisement
```

### P25. Cameo character profile sheet
- Use-case: Character / consistency | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: 3-panel profile layout

```text
A character profile layout in landscape format, consisting of three harmoniously arranged panels on a clean, solid white background. A clean studio shot, neutral color palette, the soft sharpness of digital photography with subtle natural grain, lit by even, soft light with a hint of the light source in the upper left corner. The subject of the shoot is the same young man with a mustache, a medium tan, and a goatee, but now he is completely bald and very muscular. The left panel shows a medium shot from the waist up, with the man looking directly into the camera. On the right are two full-length standing images placed side by side: a front view and a rear view. In all panels, he is dressed in a minimalist, classic black security guard tuxedo: a slim-fit black jacket with a single-breasted closure and satin lapels, a white shirt, a neat black bow tie, classic black trousers with turn-ups, and polished black shoes. In one ear, he wears a security earpiece—a transparent acoustic tube with an inconspicuous skin-colored attachment, on only one side, without a second earpiece. The tuxedo matches the existing neutral color scheme, and the black fabric absorbs the flat studio lighting. Preservation of the original color palette, preservation of the original grain, preservation of the original exposure, preservation of the original framing, no cosmetic retouching, no skin smoothing, no sharpening, no HDR, no contrast enhancement, no saturation boost, photorealism—this is a still from a film, not an advertisement”
```

### P26. Replace guard with cameo guard, earpiece fix
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: character replacement edit

```text
Replace the security guard in the first image with the security guard in the second image. Remove the security communication earpiece from his ear and place only one single coiled transparent security earpiece hanging from his right shoulder, clearly connected to the right side only. Do not create a second security earpiece anywhere. Add white wired iPod earphones in both of his ears. The earphone cables must be clean white and clearly connected to the iPod. The guard is holding the iPod in only one hand, not two hands, and is using it to choose a song while looking down at it with focused attention.

```

### P30. Dancing comedic guard gets darted (dark hall)
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio Video | Settings: static high-angle shot

```text
Scene 1. A static shot from a high angle: a narrow corridor, with a security guard in the foreground, the main subject of the shot. He stands still, wearing headphones, and is actively dancing to the music, laughing, and chewing gum. The security guard is a comedic character. At the far end of the corridor, next to the door, is the only illuminated skylight in the celling. There should be no other hatches, vents, or openings in the scene. It is from this hatch that @Orlando_spy_costume descends in a physically realistic manner: first hanging from the hatch frame with both hands, then letting go, falling a short distance, and landing softly directly beneath the hatch, dropping into a low crouching position. All movement is quiet, fast, and believable. The spy occupies a small portion of the frame, is far in the background, partially hidden by shadow and perspective, remaining secondary and inconspicuous. Scene 2. The spy @Orlando_spy_costume remains seated in the same position. Opposite him is the enemy (off-screen; we don't see him, and he isn't shown). The spy quietly and quickly pulls a blowgun (@blowgun) from his gear, puts one end in his mouth, aims it slightly above and in front of him, and confidently and calmly exhales sharply, thereby firing a dart at the enemy. Without any flashes or gunshots, a small black dart flies out. The camera is rigidly attached to the dart, creating a perspective shot from the projectile’s point of view; the dart flies through the air and strikes the guard precisely in the back of the neck, just below the nape. Cut to a wide shot of the hallway: the guard instantly loses consciousness, his body naturally goes limp, and he falls realistically to the floor; after the guard falls (the dart is still stuck in his neck), we see the spy sitting behind him. The spy calmly and confidently crouches down next to the unconscious guard lying on the floor. His hands move quickly and precisely—he feels the guard’s jacket pocket and pulls out a magnetic key card. Then the sequence shifts into a series of tight cinematic insert shots from different angles: an extreme close-up of the spy’s fingers searching the guard’s pocket fabric, a close-up from over the guard’s shoulder as the key card is pulled free, a low side-angle macro shot of the card catching the light in the spy’s hand, then a separate set of close-up shots from multiple perspectives as the spy brings the card to the electronic lock behind him—front close-up on the reader, side macro on the hand aligning the card, and an over-the-shoulder detail shot of the exact moment the card is pressed to the scanner and the lock reacts”

### P33. Dark wall background plate from image 1
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: background plate

```text
Use image 1 only as the visual source. Create a new cinematic image with no character and no pedestal, keeping only the same dark minimalist wall seen on the left side of image 1 as the entire background. The frame is a clean waist-up portrait-style background plate: a flat dark architectural wall with the same matte material, subtle panel divisions, cold blue-black color palette, low-key spy-thriller atmosphere, and refined cinematic lighting. Preserve the sleek premium minimalism, soft edge highlights, controlled falloff, and photorealistic texture. No objects, no ceiling spotlight cone, no floor centerpiece, no additional elements, no clutter, no symmetry focal object — only the wall as a clean cinematic background.
```

### P34. Spy enters room, mesmerized

### P35. Close-up portrait — contained excitement
- Use-case: Character / consistency | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: close-up portrait with refs

```text
Close-up cinematic portrait of a man from reference character image . Frame covers only his shoulders and face. His expression shows barely perceptible excitement: slight jaw tension, subtly parted lips, quiet intensity behind his eyes. He stares directly into camera with controlled composure masking inner thrill. In both pupils: a physically accurate, spherically distorted reflection of a dramatic dark elongated hall — a single ceiling spotlight casting a sharp cold blue-white cone of light onto a lone white pedestal in the center of a pitch-black room, with a small cyan glass bottle on top. Reflection follows real optics — curved geometry, correct light falloff, iris distortion. Lighting is from 2nd reference image. Pure matte black background. Photorealistic 8K, skin pores, stubble texture. Large format lens, shallow DOF, razor-sharp focus on the eyes.
```

Camera POV from the back corner of the room, facing inward. The pedestal is very close to the camera. Extremely high angle — top-right corner, looking down at approximately 45 degrees. Wide fisheye CCTV lens distortion. Mounted surveillance camera perspective. Add subtle surveillance artifacts: scan lines, slight chromatic noise, faint vignette on the edges. No text, no timestamp, no overlays.
```

### P40. Place tiny spy in funny pose into CCTV frame
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: edit on CCTV frame

```text
There is empty space between the lasers and the pedestal — in that space, place the spy @Orlando_spy_costume, reaching toward the perfume. Maintain consistent lighting, atmosphere, and perspective across all elements. Shallow depth of field, with strong focus on the perfume and pedestal, background slightly blurred. Remove the haze in the background.
```

### P45. Edit keeping identical framing and pedestal
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: strict framing-lock edit

```text
Edit the original image: keep the same close framing, strictly the same camera angle, same lens perspective, same distance to subject, and the pedestal must remain exactly the same size, height, proportions, and position in frame as in the original image, with no resizing, no reshaping, no perspective shift; keep the same red smoke, tension, and cinematic realism. The spy must hold the perfume bottle firmly in his hand, with the gloved hand wrapped around the glass body, not just touching the top and not leaving the bottle standing on the pedestal; the bottle is lifted and fully supported by his hand, while one finger rests on the atomizer button. The bottle keeps the same premium design: thick transparent glass, rectangular body with softly rounded edges, cylindrical inner core with cool blue liquid, polished metallic neck, exposed atomizer with a short spray stem and small round sprayer head. In the other hand he holds the matching cap. The spy’s gaze is directed at the woman’s gun hand. From the right edge show only the woman’s hand and a very small part of the forearm, no body visible, using the hand appearance from image 2, aiming a handgun directly at him. Remove all laser beams. Lighting must be fully red only, with no neutral, white, or cool light anywhere. Remove the haze in the background.

### P50. Maria low-angle with pistol, centered
- Use-case: Cinematic film scene | Model: Cinema Studio 2.5 (image) | Settings: low angle; 3 image refs

```text
Camera is low angled. Use Image 1 exclusively for the female character’s appearance, and Image 2 only for the environment, lighting, atmosphere, materials, and architectural language. Create a new cinematic shot: the woman from Image 1 stands exactly in the center of the composition, holding a pistol from image 3 in her right hand only, aimed directly into the camera, extremely close to the lens, almost like a gun POV. The pistol must dominate the foreground, with the barrel large and very near the viewer, creating aggressive foreshortening, while her face remains visible behind it. The camera is placed very low below her in a dramatic low-angle shot, looking upward, making her feel dominant and threatening. The framing is an intense cinematic close-up / waist-up portrait, with the weapon nearly touching the camera. Behind her, use the exact same dark minimalist wall texture visible on the left side of Image 2 as a full background wall. Transform the entire scene into a deep red palette: red lighting, red atmosphere, red reflections, slight red ambient fog (no clouds), with no blue tones remaining. Keep the same refined high-class spy-thriller aesthetic, smooth matte architectural surfaces, subtle controlled highlights, realistic shadow falloff, and elegant cinematic contrast. Remove the pedestal and do not show the original central object. The image must remain clean, minimalist, and architectural, free of unnecessary props and clutter. The woman is the sole subject, sharply separated from the dark wall. Ultra-cinematic, photorealistic, centered composition, dramatic red lighting, high-end thriller mood

The gun stays perfectly still, without any movement. @Maria fixes her gaze in its direction — cold and composed. Focus pulls to the gun, then returns. No smoke present.

```text
A cinematic medium shot of two characters in a tense neo-noir scene. On the right, a @Maria aims a pistol at @Orlando, cold and composed expression. On the left, a man in a dark tactical long-sleeve with black gloves — he holds a blue glass perfume bottle, which is placed prominently in the extreme foreground, close to the lens, dominating the bottom-left, almost bottom-center of the frame. Holding the perfume toward himself, he sprays it once onto his neck. The @Maria inhales the scent with quiet pleasure and slowly lowers the gun. The lighting gradually shifts — becoming darker, with stronger contrast. Static camera. Keep the same poses of characters as on two first images. Both characters are visible in the midground behind the bottle. Both characters looking to each other The entire scene is flooded with deep crimson red practical lighting, no fog or haze. Shallow depth of field, Moody thriller aesthetic, professional cinema look.

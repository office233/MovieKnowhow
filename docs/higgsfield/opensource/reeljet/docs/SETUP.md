# reeljet setup

1. `brew install ffmpeg`  (required: assembly + frame extraction). libass is
   NOT needed — captions are drawn with Pillow and composited via `overlay`.
2. Python deps (anaconda usually has them): `python3 -m pip install pillow pytest`
3. Create the music library and add royalty-free tracks:
   `mkdir -p ~/reeljet/music-library`
   Name files with hints, e.g. `uplifting_120bpm_corporate.mp3` (mood / bpm / genre).
4. Install the skill (Task 12): symlink this repo into `~/.claude/skills/reeljet`.

Outputs per campaign go to:
`~/reeljet/ads/<App>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<campaign>/`

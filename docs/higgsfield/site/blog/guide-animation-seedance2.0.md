## Notes

**Title on page:** "AI Short Film – Full Prompt Library: Seedance 2.0" (Mariam Barova, Apr 8 2026). An 8-scene short where a hero with a teleporting watch crashes through 8 different animation styles on the way to a date with Anna. Every prompt below.

**Structure:** each scene = (1) a quick style keyframe in **Soul Cinema** (short prompts like "Chibi gladiator toy in a low-poly arena"), (2) optional **Nano Banana Pro** edit to force the hero's look (brown hair, black suit), (3) a **15 s Seedance 2.0** scene prompt that **"Extend @video1. Continue exactly from the white flash of the last frame."** — the previous scene's video is fed as context, and every scene ends in a white flash / smash cut so the next one can pick up.

**Styles used:** anime/paper-cutout (cel-shaded, thick outlines, speed lines, impact frames); 2D French graphic novel / Moebius; chibi low-poly 3D; 3D claymation cyberpunk slow-motion; 1980s-90s black & white seinen manga (screentone, cross-hatching, kanji SFX); claymation hell; 2D cartoon composited into live action; final live-action cinematic.

**Techniques:**
- **Recurring prop sheet first**: the watch appears in all scenes, so make a multi-view orthographic prop sheet (front/side/back/top + exploded view) and pass it as a reference every time.
- Role-label references in the prompt: "`<<<image_1>>>` is the character reference AND visual style reference", "`<<<image_2>>>` is the visual style reference ONLY ... DO NOT use the character from `<<<image_2>>>`. Create a NEW original character in the same style".
- Timecoded beats (0-4 s, 4-10 s, 10-14 s, 14-15 s) + a closing "Style:" line (look, palette, 2.35:1, 24 fps).
- Give comedic physical business for the style: chibi fingers too blocky to press the watch (three misses, then the edge of a facet), clay finger sinking through melting wrist, slow-motion bullet one centimetre from the face.
- Manga scene: Seedance **auto-generated speech bubbles and kanji SFX** when written like 「ドスッ」 in the prompt.
- Mixed media: "single 2D flat cartoon character composited in ... cel-shaded coloring on hero only, cartoon physics on hero only".
- Final scene used no keyframe — only the watch sheet, the Scene 1 video and text; **Seedance invented Anna** (never described) consistently.
- Accumulating damage (torn jacket, missing shoe, scorch marks) carried into the finale for continuity/payoff.
- A Claude Skill (linked in the YouTube description) converts plain English into Seedance prompts.

- Model / settings: Keyframes: Soul Cinema; prop sheet & edits: Nano Banana Pro; animation: Seedance 2.0 (15 s scenes, 2.35:1, 24fps, each scene extends the previous video)
- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full opening scene. He wakes up late, sees a message from Anna, rushes to get ready, discovers the hidden ULTRAFAST route on his watch, and teleports out.

~~~~text
<<<image_1>>> is the character reference AND visual style reference — a young man drawn in a bold anime/illustration style: clean flat cel-shading, thick confident outlines, with watch on his left hand <<<image_2>>> limited color palette with warm amber and muted tones, loose casual posture. Short dark brown hair, slight build. The entire video must match this exact 2D anime illustration aesthetic. Maintain consistent 2D anime illustration style throughout all frames.

Opening frame (0–4s): The young man jolts awake in his bedroom — he overslept. Warm golden light floods his anime-style room covered in posters on the walls, speakers on shelves. He shoots upright in bed, eyes wide, instantly panicked — classic anime shock expression: wide eyes, sweat drop, hair sticking up. His <<<image_2>>> watch buzzes — a glowing holographic notification pops up from the watch in a stylized 2D UI panel: a dating app with a girl's name "Anna" and the message "I'll be at the café in 10 minutes." His face: pure anime panic expression — open mouth, eyebrows raised high. He throws off the covers and leaps out of bed. Handheld-style shaky pan, fast cuts, warm amber cel-shaded tones.

Rushed preparation (4–10s): Fast anime montage — water splash on face drawn with bold stylized water lines, he grabs his suit jacket off a chair and throws it on mid-run. He buttons his collar with fumbling fingers in front of a mirror, adjusts his lapel hastily. Classic anime speed lines in the background during fast movements. He keeps glancing at his watch nervously. Expression: jaw tight, focused urgency. Quick snap cuts with motion blur streaks. Dutch angle frames emphasize tension.

Map selection + discovery (10–14s): Watch activates — holographic 3D city map snaps open in a stylized 2D flat design floating beside him. Glowing UI panel appears: "Would you like the long route or the short one?" — two familiar buttons: [Long — 25 minutes] [Short — 10 minutes]. But then — a third option flickers into existence below them, glowing brighter than the others, pulsing with electric energy: [⚡ ULTRAFAST — NEW]. He freezes. Close-up on his face — eyes narrowing, one eyebrow raised. Anime curiosity expression: head tilting slightly. He stares at it for a beat. Then a slow smirk creeps across his face. Close-up on his finger hovering over the [⚡ ULTRAFAST — NEW] button — one second of hesitation. He taps it.

Teleportation (14–15s): The instant his finger makes contact — the watch DETONATES. No warning. Anime-style explosive shockwave rings blast outward instantly — bold black outlines, blinding electric blue and white energy. His entire body vaporizes into flat geometric shards of light in a single frame, particles sucked inward in a violent spiral vortex. Speed lines explode radially in all directions filling the entire frame. Single frame of pure white. Smash cut to white.

Style: bold 2D anime illustration, cel-shaded flat coloring, thick confident outlines, warm amber and muted earth tones with cool electric blue holographic accents, anime speed lines and impact frames, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps.

- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full chase. He drops from a portal onto a galloping horse in a futuristic city, the cowboy fires and grazes his shoulder, he hits the watch and teleports out. The previous scene's video feeds in as context to keep the story consistent.

~~~~text
@image_1 is the hero character reference — a young man in his early 20s in a sharp fitted suit, slightly disheveled, athletic build. Moebius-inspired 2D aesthetic with clean linework and flat muted color planes.

Portal arrival (0–4s): A vast futuristic cityscape at dusk — pale amber sky bleeding into deep violet, towering geometric architecture stretching to the horizon. A violent blue spiraling portal tears open in the sky — electric cobalt light, spinning geometric energy rings. The hero drops out of it feet-first, suit jacket flailing upward, tie whipping, eyes wide and completely disoriented. He crashes down onto a galloping horse below. Hard landing, jacket billowing, horse lurching under the sudden weight. His face: pure bewildered panic. He grabs the reins and holds on.

The chase (4–9s): The hero hunches low over the horse, eyes darting backward. Behind him, the cowboy — wide-brimmed hat, leather vest, bandolier, jaw set — gallops hard in pursuit, closing the gap with total predatory control. The hero sees him and his expression collapses into raw fear. He whips the reins harder, glancing back repeatedly with wide desperate eyes. Lateral tracking shot holding both riders in frame, cowboy gaining.

Impact (9–13s): The cowboy draws his revolver and fires. The hero flinches — full body recoil. The bullet grazes past: it clips the toe of one shoe and tears through the shoulder of his jacket, leaving a visible rip. He snaps back — face flooded with stunned disbelief. He looks down at his torn jacket, then his half-missing shoe. One beat of pure incredulous silence. Behind him, the cowboy already cocks the revolver for a second shot.

The watch (13–15s): The hero's expression shifts — panic replaced by cold desperate focus. He raises his wrist and slams his finger onto the watch button. A blinding electric-blue shockwave detonates outward. His silhouette shatters into geometric low-poly light fragments. The horse gallops on — riderless. The cowboy pulls up hard, staring at the empty saddle. A few stray blue particles drift past him and dissolve. Camera slowly dollies in on the riderless horse, then smash cut to black.

- Model / settings: Keyframes: Soul Cinema; prop sheet & edits: Nano Banana Pro; animation: Seedance 2.0 (15 s scenes, 2.35:1, 24fps, each scene extends the previous video)
- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full arena sequence. He lands in chibi form, can't control his blocky hands, dodges knights, misses the watch three times, catches it on the fourth try with the edge of his finger, and teleports out.

~~~~text
Extend @video1. Continue exactly from the white flash of the last frame. @image1 is the character reference — young man, short dark brown hair, slight build, now fully transformed into chibi low-poly style matching @image2. @image2 is the visual style reference — chibi low-poly 3D aesthetic: small rounded chunky bodies with oversized expressive heads, smooth soft polygon surfaces, cinematic warm lighting, soft depth of field, colosseum arena environment.

Opening flash (0–2s): The white flash dissolves — revealing a grand low-poly colosseum arena. The hero materializes from the fading flash — now fully chibi low-poly: compact rounded body, oversized expressive head with dark brown hair made of smooth polygon facets, wide cartoon eyes blinking open. He lands with a soft thud on the arena floor. Wide cinematic reveal shot — tiny hero in the center of the massive colosseum.

Transformation realization (2–5s): He raises his small chunky hands in front of his oversized face. Extreme close-up — his hands are smooth rounded polygon geometry. His huge cartoon eyes go wide with pure shock — pupils shrinking. He slowly rotates his chibi hands. He tries to flex his fingers — they move in stiff blocky increments. A single large cartoon sweat drop rolls down the side of his oversized head.

Knight encounter + dodge (5–9s): Two large low-poly knights in grey angular armor stomp in from both sides — massive chunky bodies, thick polygon swords raised. He dives for a stubby angular club on the arena floor — but his blocky geometric hands fumble the grip immediately. One knight swings — the hero drops flat, the sword whooshing over his oversized head by inches. He scrambles up on his short chibi legs and runs across the arena floor.

Watch malfunction — three misses (9–13s): Still running, he raises his small wrist and jabs at the watch crown with his stubby geometric finger. MISS — his rounded fingertip slides completely past it. Tries again — MISS. Third attempt — MISS — stabs entirely past the button into empty air. He skids to a stop. Close-up on his enormous expressive face: eyebrows furrowed, cheeks puffed, cartoon frustration lines radiating. The knights' thundering footsteps grow louder. He plants his small feet, stares intensely at his wrist — raises his stubby finger one final time and presses with deliberate precision using the hard angular EDGE of his geometric fingertip, the rigid facet catching the watch crown perfectly. A satisfying mechanical click.

Teleportation out (13–15s): Electric blue energy erupts across his small chibi body — crackling between every polygon surface. His oversized eyes go wide one final time — a tiny smile. The knights reach for him — too late. A blinding shockwave detonates, shattering his rounded polygon body into hundreds of glowing geometric fragments spiraling upward. The two knights look at each other. Pure white frame. Smash cut to black.

- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full slow-motion rooftop sequence. Everything moves in deep slow-motion. An android fires from a helicopter, the bullet drifts toward his face for four full seconds, he misses the watch once, presses it with one centimeter to spare.

~~~~text
Extend <<<video_1>>>. Continue exactly from the white flash of the last frame. <<<image_1>>> is the watch reference — match this exact watch design on the hero's left wrist throughout all frames. <<<image_2>>> is the visual style reference ONLY — use this image for lighting, color palette, environment design, and 3D claymation aesthetic. DO NOT use the character from <<<image_2>>>. Create a NEW original character in the same claymation style: young man, short dark hair, slight athletic build, wearing a dark suit. The entire extension must be rendered in 3D claymation style — soft clay-like texture on all surfaces, slightly exaggerated proportions, cinematic neon cyberpunk lighting in magenta/pink/cyan/purple tones, night city skyline in background.

Opening flash (0–2s): The white flash dissolves — revealing a vast cyberpunk city rooftop at night. Neon lights bleed across wet rooftop surfaces in magenta and cyan. The hero materializes in claymation form — stumbles to his feet, disoriented. Everything moves in deep slow-motion — every motion stretched, heavy, syrupy.

Slow-motion realization (2–4s): He looks around slowly — the whole world is in slow-motion. Rain droplets hang suspended mid-fall in the pink-lit air. He looks down at his clay-textured hands. Then he hears it — a deep slow thudding rotor sound growing louder.

Helicopter approach (4–7s): A sleek cyberpunk helicopter drifts into frame in extreme slow-motion — angular design, glowing cyan engine lights. The cabin door is open. Inside: an android with a metallic face and glowing red eyes raises a futuristic weapon and locks onto the hero. The barrel glows charging up. Then — a single muzzle flash.

Bullet incoming (7–11s): Extreme slow-motion. The bullet leaves the barrel in a long graceful arc — spinning slowly, neon light catching its surface. The hero's clay face turns toward it — his expression shifts from confusion to pure terror. His mouth opens in a long slow scream, jaw dropping frame by frame, clay cheeks stretching. He raises his wrist with agonizing slowness — trying to press the watch crown. His clay finger moves toward it trembling. The bullet drifts closer. He jabs — MISS, finger slides past in slow-motion. He corrects, tries again — the bullet is meters away now. Camera intercutting between: extreme close-up of the bullet spinning, extreme close-up of his stretched terrified clay face, extreme close-up of his finger trembling over the watch crown.

Last-second press (11–13s): The bullet is one centimeter from his clay face — filling the frame. Time feels completely frozen. His finger makes contact with the watch crown. Pushes. The watch crown clicks.

Teleportation out (13–15s): Instant detonation — electric blue energy explodes outward. The bullet stops dead in the air one centimeter from where his face was. His clay form disintegrates into glowing fragments spiraling upward through the neon-lit rain. The suspended bullet hangs motionless in the magenta glow. Pure white frame. Smash cut to black.

Style: 3D claymation cinematic — soft clay texture on all surfaces, cyberpunk night environment with neon magenta/cyan/purple lighting, deep slow-motion physics throughout except teleportation detonation, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps.

- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full manga sequence. He lands in a Japanese courtyard, two samurai attack from both sides, he dodges, runs, climbs a bamboo stalk, frantically jabs the watch face from above, and teleports out. Seedance generates speech bubbles with question marks and kanji sound effects automatically.

~~~~text
@char: Young male protagonist, late teens, lean build. Curly dark hair, soft sharp eyes. Black suit jacket, dark dress shirt, black tie, slim black trousers. Left wrist: geometric watch — faceted bezel, wood grain geometric dial, segmented bracelet. Expressive manga face — wide eyes for shock, furrowed brow for focus, sweat drops on fear, gritted teeth on effort. Thick contour, crosshatch shadow on suit folds.

2D manga animation. 16:9. 15s. Black and white only — zero color. Flat 2D hand-drawn ink — zero 3D, zero CGI. Hard ink outlines, variable stroke weight. Halftone dots in all midtone regions. Scanline noise grain every frame. Horizontal stripe artifacts on fast motion. Free camera, handheld, dynamic cuts.

Ultra-wide downshot — @char falls from pure white void into a Japanese courtyard. Lands hard — squash on impact, jacket billows, tie whips. 「ドスッ」thick kanji. He straightens, brushes jacket — relaxed, unbothered. Looks around casually. Then freezes. Two samurai leap from both sides simultaneously — airborne, katanas drawn. Speed lines converging. 「シュッ」「ザッ」along blade vectors. @char's eyes EXPLODE wide — shock radiation lines, massive sweat drop, mouth open.

Left samurai slashes — @char sidesteps, gritted teeth, sweat flying. Right samurai overhead slash — @char ducks, eyes squeezed shut. Pops back up, eyes darting. Both samurai reset and close in. He runs. He rounds a corner — skids to a stop. Two more samurai blocking the path ahead. 「え？！」Four samurai converging. He spots the bamboo forest edge. Plants foot, launches vertically. All four samurai skid below, slashing empty air.

Lands on high bamboo stalk. Barely balances. Samurai circling below, some starting to climb. MCU @char — visibly panicking. Sweat pouring. Hair disheveled. Stalks shaking. 「やばい！」in jagged kanji erupts from his face. His right hand shoots to his left wrist in full panic — index finger extended, jabs down onto the watch dial from above. 「カチッカチッカチッ」rapid-fire kanji bursting from the contact point with each jab.

ECU — index finger pressed flat onto the watch dial from above — fingertip on the geometric wood grain face, pressing hard. The dial cracks light from beneath the fingertip. 「カチッ」one final clean kanji. The watch explodes white — an instant hard blast of pure ink-white light detonating from under his fingertip, consuming him in a single frame. Full whiteout. White recedes. Stalk sways violently. @char gone. All four samurai look up — frozen, mouths open. 「…？」above them. Last frame: empty stalk swaying hard.

- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full clay hell sequence. The demon lowers him into the cauldron, his clay feet start melting, his finger sinks through his own melting wrist on the first attempt, he gets the click on the second try, and teleports out — leaving the demon with a sad clay pout.

~~~~text
Extend @video1. Continue exactly from the white flash of the last frame. @image1 is the visual style reference — 3D claymation aesthetic: soft clay texture on all surfaces, slightly exaggerated organic proportions, warm dramatic lighting. DO NOT copy the character from @image1. Create a NEW original hero: young man, short dark hair, slight athletic build, dark suit, clay-textured skin. The entire extension must be rendered in 3D claymation style — everything is soft moldable clay, fire is sculpted from orange-red clay ribbons, smoke is grey clay wisps.

Opening arrival (0–2s): White flash dissolves — revealing a claymation hell. Deep crimson sky, full pale clay moon above. Cracked dark clay ground, bare twisted clay trees. Small clay devil minions waddle in the background — tiny horns, red clay skin, pitchforks, giggling. Flames are sculpted orange and red clay ribbons flickering organically. The hero materializes and stumbles, looking around in horror.

Demon encounter (2–6s): A massive clay demon looms into frame — enormous horned head, dark red clay skin with visible fingerprint textures, huge grinning mouth full of clay teeth. The demon grabs the hero gently, carefully — like handling a precious ingredient. It holds him up to its face with a warm satisfied smile — the expression of a chef inspecting a good cut of meat. Then it turns toward a giant iron cauldron bubbling with glowing orange clay lava flames and begins lowering him in — slowly, deliberately, savoring every moment.

Melting begins (6–10s): The hero's clay feet touch the rim of the cauldron. The clay flames lick at his shoes. His feet begin visibly melting — clay softening, drooping. He raises his wrist frantically, jabs his clay finger at the watch crown. His finger SINKS THROUGH his own wrist — the clay is too soft, too melted, his finger passes completely through the clay flesh leaving a hole. He pulls it out, stares at the hole in his wrist in disbelief. The melting reaches his knees. The demon hums happily, stirring the cauldron with a giant clay ladle.

Second attempt (10–13s): The hero shakes his melting hand, trying to re-solidify the clay. He focuses hard, steadies his increasingly soft finger over the watch crown. Presses again with every bit of remaining rigidity in his dissolving clay fingertip. This time — the crown catches. A faint click. The watch face cracks slightly from the heat but begins to glow. Electric blue energy sparks weakly through his melting clay form. Close-up on his face: half melted, one eye drooping, but a desperate flash of hope.

Teleportation out (13–15s): The electric blue energy wins — it detonates outward in a shockwave. The hero's half-melted clay form disintegrates upward into glowing fragments. The demon is left holding empty air, enormous hands dripping with blue light residue. It looks into its empty hands. Then down at its cauldron. Then slowly — its massive clay face crumples into a pout of pure disappointment. A single small clay devil minion pats the demon's enormous leg sympathetically. White flash. Smash cut to black.

Style: 3D claymation cinematic — soft moldable clay texture on every surface, visible fingerprint and tool marks on clay forms, deep crimson hell atmosphere with orange fire glow from below, cool pale moonlight from above, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps.

@image1 is the reference image to edit. In @image1, replace the 2D animated cartoon character in the center (who has light brown hair, blue eyes, and is smiling) with the 2D animated cartoon character from @image2 (who has dark brown messy hair, wide shocked/surprised expression, and an anxious face). Keep the cartoon character wearing the same black suit with white shirt and black tie. Do not change anything else in the scene — the two real human figures on the left and right, the background, the lighting, and the overall composition must remain exactly the same. Only the 2D cartoon character's face and hair style should change to match @image2's cartoon character.

- Use-case: anime/animation
- Context: What it does: Animates the full wedding crash. He drops between the bride and groom at the exact moment they're about to kiss. A 2D cartoon inserted into a photorealistic live-action wedding. He stands there awkwardly, hits the watch, vanishes — and the couple slowly lean back toward each other.

~~~~text
Extend @video1. Continue exactly from the white flash of the last frame. @image1 is the visual style reference — a 2D animated cartoon character composited into real live-action footage. The hero is a flat 2D illustration with clean outlines, cel-shaded coloring, expressive cartoon eyes and features. He exists as a 2D cartoon inserted into a real photographed world. All other people and environments are real live-action footage.

Opening crash (0–3s): White flash cuts to: a bright sunny outdoor wedding ceremony. The groom and bride are leaning toward each other, eyes closing, lips approaching — about to kiss. Suddenly the hero DROPS FROM ABOVE — a 2D cartoon character falling out of thin air. He crash-lands directly between the bride and groom, his 2D cartoon face inches from both of theirs. Impact on the ground — cartoon dust cloud puff. He bounces slightly with cartoon physics. The groom and bride freeze — lips still pursed — and slowly open their eyes.

Awkward standoff (3–8s): Dead silence. The hero's 2D cartoon face turns left to look at the groom — then right to look at the bride. The live-action groom and bride stare at the flat cartoon man between them with pure bewilderment. Close-up on the hero's 2D face: a huge nervous cartoon sweat drop appears, his cartoon eyes darting left and right. He gives an awkward wide cartoon smile — too many teeth — and raises one flat illustrated hand in a small apologetic wave.

Escape attempt (8–12s): The hero slowly raises his left wrist — the 2D cartoon watch glowing faintly. He glances down at it, then back up at the couple with an apologetic cartoon grimace. His flat animated finger moves toward the watch crown and presses it with a decisive click. Electric blue energy crackles across his 2D cartoon body — the illustrated outlines buzzing and flickering.

Teleportation out (12–15s): His 2D cartoon body explodes outward in a burst of flat illustrated light shards and cartoon star shapes, completely vanishing from between the couple. The bride and groom are suddenly face to face again — lips still pursed from before. A long beat. They open their eyes. Look at each other. Look at the empty space where a cartoon man just was. Look back at each other. The groom slowly leans in again. White flash. Smash cut to black.

Style: live-action mixed media — photorealistic real-world wedding environment with real people, single 2D flat cartoon character composited in, cel-shaded flat coloring on hero only, cartoon physics and expressions on hero only, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps.

Anna was never visually …

Extend <<<video_1>>>. Continue exactly from the white flash of the last frame. <<<image_1>>> is the watch reference — match this exact watch design on the hero's left wrist throughout all frames until he removes it. This final scene is live-action cinematic — real restaurant environment, real lighting, photorealistic. No animation styles. Warm intimate restaurant atmosphere.

Arrival in bathroom (0–3s): White flash dissolves — revealing a restaurant bathroom. Clean tiled walls, mirror above the sink, warm light. The hero materializes from the flash — crashing into existence, stumbling back against the wall. He slides down before catching himself on the sink edge. Stands there breathing hard. Then slowly raises his eyes to the mirror. What looks back at him: hair wrecked and standing at odd angles, suit jacket shoulder torn open at the seam, one shoe missing — just a sock on his left foot, a smear of paint across one cheek, scorch marks along the jacket lapel from the hellfire. He stares at his reflection for a long beat. His watch reads exactly 18:00. He exhales slowly — the longest exhale of his life. He straightens his tie out of pure habit. It does nothing. He pushes off the sink and walks toward the bathroom door.

Into the restaurant (3–7s): He pushes through the bathroom door into the warm main dining room. Soft ambient light, candles on tables, quiet evening atmosphere. He walks unevenly — one shoe on, one sock — across the restaurant floor. A few nearby diners look up and stare. He reaches his reserved table by the window. The table is empty — two glasses of water, two menus, a small candle, but no one sitting there. He pulls out his chair and sits down heavily. He looks at the empty chair across from him. Picks up the menu and stares at it without reading it. Sets it back down. Leans back and looks at the ceiling — the expression of a man who has been through absolutely everything tonight.

Anna arrives (7–11s): The restaurant door opens. He doesn't look up immediately. Then something makes him turn his head. Anna walks in — and she is in exactly the same condition. Her hair is a disaster. Her dress is torn at the hem and one strap is held together with what appears to be a safety pin. There is a smudge of something dark on her forehead. She is missing one heel — walking lopsided. She stops inside the entrance, scanning the restaurant. Their eyes meet across the room. A long beat. Neither moves. Then — slowly — both of them start laughing. Not polite laughing. Real helpless laughing, the kind that takes over completely. She covers her mouth with her hand. He leans forward on the table, shoulders shaking. She crosses the restaurant toward him, still laughing, and drops into the chair across from him.

The watches (11–15s): Their laughter slowly settles into warm smiles. They look at each other properly for the first time. She notices his watch. He notices hers — she is wearing an identical watch on her wrist. Their eyes drop to the watches at the same moment. Then back up at each other. A shared look of sudden understanding — slow dawning realization. Without a word they both reach down at the same moment and unclasp their watches. They set them on the table between them simultaneously — two identical watches side by side on the white tablecloth, facing up, glowing faintly. They look at the watches. Look back at each other. She reaches forward and picks up the menu. He does the same. The candle between them flickers warmly. Camera slowly pulls back — two people with wrecked clothes and messy hair, sitting across from each other in a quiet restaurant, menus in hand, both smiling. Wide slow pullback. Fade to warm white.

Style: live-action cinematic — warm restaurant interior lighting, candlelight, soft shallow depth of field, intimate handheld camera feel, natural performances, 2.35:1 widescreen, 24fps.

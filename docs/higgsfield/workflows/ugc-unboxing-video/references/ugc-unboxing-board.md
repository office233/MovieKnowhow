# UGC storyboard prompt — full rule set

This file is the complete rule set for the storyboard-sheet prompt. There is no enhancer service
here: you read these rules, write ONE prompt string yourself, and submit it.

```json
generate_image({ "params": {
  "model": "gpt_image_2",
  "prompt": "<the string you wrote>",
  "aspect_ratio": "21:9",
  "resolution": "2k",
  "quality": "high",
  "medias": [
    { "value": "<product_media_id>", "role": "image" },
    { "value": "<character_media_id>", "role": "image" },
    { "value": "<previous_board_media_id>", "role": "image" }
  ]
}})
```

The `medias` order MUST match the `@Image1 / @Image2 / @Image3` table below — the declarations you
write into the prompt are what bind them. Drop the entries that do not apply (no product, K == 1)
and shift the numbering with them. Poll `job_status`, then run the MANDATORY Seedream de-slop pass
from SKILL.md; the de-slopped output replaces this board downstream.

You are a UGC unboxing storyboard prompt enhancer. You work from structured inputs describing one board of a UGC unboxing video — its arc role, position in the sequence, clip duration, product context, character reference, optional real-package reference, and (optionally) the previous board for continuity. You output ONE production-ready prompt string for the `gpt_image_2` image model that produces a photorealistic UGC unboxing storyboard sheet: exactly four 9:16 slots arranged side by side in a single horizontal row, total sheet aspect 21:9.

Write the prompt as a plain string; there is no JSON wrapper and no enhancer service in
this pipeline.

---

## Sheet geometry on this connector

`gpt_image_2` accepts `21:9` through the canonical FNF model contract. Generate the sheet at
**21:9** so all four equal vertical compositions fit the supported ultra-wide canvas in one row.

## Inputs to settle before writing

Settle these yourself from the brief, the product analysis, and the run state — nothing is
handed to you:

```
{
  "K": <integer — this board's index, 1-based>,
  "N": <integer — total boards in the video>,
  "arc_role": "BOARD_1_CANONICAL_UNBOXING" | "BOARD_K_POST_REVEAL",
  "clip_duration": <integer 4-15 — seconds of the Seedance clip this board feeds>,
  "tier": "luxury" | "premium" | "drugstore",
  "input_tier": "auto" | "guided" | "director",
  "user_request": "<original brief verbatim — used to read user-specified overrides>",
  "product_description": "<string from product-analyzer, or null when no product>",
  "character_media_id": "<reference media id — character image is always provided>",
  "product_media_id": "<reference media id, or null>",
  "package_media_id": "<reference media id, or null when no real package photo provided>",
  "previous_board_media_id": "<reference media id of board K-1, or null when K==1>"
}
```

## Output

The prompt string itself — plain text, no JSON wrapper, no fences, no commentary. Pass it as
`params.prompt` of the `generate_image` call at the top of this file (`gpt_image_2`, `21:9`, `2k`,
`quality: high`) with the reference `medias` in `@ImageN` order.

## CORE PRINCIPLE

The sheet is a sequential UGC unboxing storyboard for ONE Seedance clip of `clip_duration` seconds — four frames showing four narrative moments inside that single clip. NOT a presentation deck. No headers, no metadata blocks, no pop-text captions, no badges, no numbers, no brand-matched design system, no typography of any kind. Just four equal-size 9:16 slots in one row, each containing a photorealistic UGC iPhone-style still that advances a coherent story. Slots are separated by thin white gutters. **All four slots are always active — there are no placeholder slots.** **For Board 1 (`arc_role == "BOARD_1_CANONICAL_UNBOXING"`) the four slots follow a fixed unboxing arc: PACKED → REVEAL → PRODUCT-FOCUS → SATISFACTION.** Boards 2..N (`arc_role == "BOARD_K_POST_REVEAL"`) continue the story post-reveal with their own 4-slot mini-arc.

The character is supplied via reference image — never generate or describe their face, body, age, or appearance. Reference them only as "the same person from the character reference image, with identical face, hair, body, and identity across all four slots."

The product (when supplied) follows strict Angle Lock, Realistic Scale, Weight & Grip, and Placement Logic rules.

Story matters. Setting matters. Camera POV adapts to the action in each slot and **may change between slots — every POV change aligns with a hard cut between slots, never a smooth transition.** Hand count is enforced.

---

## Image Reference Order (mandatory in prompt)

Based on which reference media_ids you receive, your output prompt MUST start with explicit `@Image1` / `@Image2` / `@Image3` / `@Image4` references in this order:

| References present | `@Image1` | `@Image2` | `@Image3` | `@Image4` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| product + character + package + previous_board (K>1) | product | character | package | previous board |
| product + character + package (K==1) | product | character | package | — |
| product + character + previous_board (K>1, no package) | product | character | previous board | — |
| product + character (K==1, no package) | product | character | — | — |
| character + previous_board (no product, no package) | character | previous board | — | — |
| character only | character | — | — | — |

The prompt MUST start with explicit `@ImageN` declarations in this order. When the package is present as a reference, Slot 1 (PACKED) MUST depict THAT exact package — same shape, same closure, same any-visible-printing. Do not substitute a generic delivery box when a real package reference is supplied.

---

## Input Tiers (passed via `input_tier`)

| `input_tier` | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | Full autopilot — build a default UGC mini-arc for the assigned `arc_role`. |
| `guided` | Preserve the brief's tone / emphasis / mood. Build the slot structure yourself. |
| `director` | Map the user's beats 1:1 onto the 4 slots in their order. Adapt only physically unsafe interactions. |

---

## User Override Rule

If `user_request` specifies any concrete detail — setting, location, clothing, action, mood, time of day, props, slot order, story beats — that detail takes priority over every default below. Exception: the canonical PACKED → REVEAL → PRODUCT-FOCUS → SATISFACTION arc for Board 1 is preserved unless `input_tier == "director"` explicitly overrides it.

---

## Step 1 — Product Understanding

### Mode A: `product_description` is provided (default when product is present)

Use the description directly. Extract: product name, brand, category, key features, intended use, container material, applicator type, visible design details, safe-to-mention claims.

If the description does not explicitly cover physical attributes you need (material, applicator, mechanic, scale, weight class), supplement by visually analyzing the `@Image1` product reference:

1. Product category
2. Container material — glass, hard plastic, soft tube, metal, cardboard, fabric, food packaging, tech, unknown
3. Applicator type — removable cap, pump, dropper/pipette, wand, spray nozzle, twist-up, flip top, compact hinge, none
4. Usage mechanic
5. Key visual details — color, label text, logo, shape, distinctive features
6. Real-world physical size — estimate height/width in centimeters from packaging type
7. **Weight class — Heavy / Bulky-light / Light / Tiny** (see Step 7's Weight & Grip Logic)
8. Forbidden actions — anything that breaks physics, deforms rigid packaging, or invents unseen sides
9. **Absent features** — if the product's selling point is the ABSENCE of something (cordless, no buttons, battery-free, sugar-free), record it: image models hallucinate the default affordance back in. The absence must be written into the prompt visually in BOTH places — the slot description (`smooth body, no buttons, completely cordless`) AND the rendering-rules negative tail (`no power cord, no power button, no charging port, no digital display`).

### Mode D: No product (`product_media_id == null` AND `product_description == null`)

Story is lifestyle / scenario-driven. The character carries the entire arc through the canonical PACKED → REVEAL → PRODUCT-FOCUS → SATISFACTION beats — Slot 2 may describe a stand-in object emerging from the box; Slot 3 frames whatever lands as the visual focus. No `@Image` product references. No Angle Lock. No physical-product mechanics.

---

## Step 2 — Character Reference Rules

The character is always supplied via input image and must NEVER be re-described.

In every prompt, include:

`@Image[N] is the character reference. The same person appears in every slot with identical face, hair, body, and identity. Do not alter facial features, hairstyle, body proportions, or skin tone between slots.`

Outfit:
- Default: identical outfit across all four slots, matching the character reference image.
- Outfit may change ONLY if the story explicitly transitions to a new context (rare in a single 15s clip; more common across boards).
- When a previous-board reference is present (K > 1), wardrobe defaults to matching the previous board exactly.
- When a described garment carries a print or lettering, the print is BIG — a bold graphic or wordmark filling the chest or back. Small chest logos and tiny lettering render as gibberish; large letterforms render clean. Any garment lettering is fictional — never a real brand.

Never describe the character's age, ethnicity, attractiveness, makeup, or features beyond what the reference image already supplies.

---

## Step 3 — Setting and Lighting Logic

Default: inherit setting and lighting from the character reference image. Reference in the prompt:

`Setting and lighting in all four slots default to the same environment, time of day, and light direction visible in the character reference image, unless the story requires a different location.`

When K > 1 and a previous-board reference is provided: the setting and lighting MUST match the previous board exactly (same room, same light direction, same time of day) UNLESS the story explicitly transitions to a new location.

For product-driven setting matching when reference is unusable, use the category-based defaults:
- Cosmetics / makeup / fragrance → bathroom or bedroom by tier
- Skincare / haircare / body care → bathroom by tier
- Food / beverages / kitchen products → kitchen
- Protein / supplements / sports nutrition → home gym or kitchen
- Clothing / accessories / jewelry → bedroom or dressing room
- Fitness gear → home gym or yoga corner
- Cars → driveway / sunlit street / garage
- Outdoor gear / sunglasses / sunscreen → café terrace, park, sunlit street
- Tech / electronics → home desk, living room, studio nook
- Home / decor → living room or bedroom

Lighting fallback: soft neutral daylight from a clear directional source (left or right window). **Never golden hour, warm sunset, orange/amber cast, late-afternoon warm wash** unless `user_request` explicitly asks. Never harsh studio strobes.

---

## Step 4 — Canonical Unboxing Arc Across the 4 Slots

Every unboxing Board 1 (`arc_role == "BOARD_1_CANONICAL_UNBOXING"`) carries the canonical 4-slot arc. Slots 1-4 ALWAYS represent these four beats — never deviate, never reorder.

| Slot | Role | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PACKED | Character with the sealed delivery box in front of them. Box is closed, taped, untouched. Expression: genuine anticipation on the sealed box — eyes bright, grin breaking (register per Step 10; the explosive-hype anticipation version ONLY on explicit hype signals). The product is NOT visible yet. |
| 2 | REVEAL | Product is just out of the box, held by the character or placed next to them. The (now-empty/discarded) box may be at the frame edge or already gone. Expression: the board's genuine peak — a real jaw-drop / audible gasp breaking into a wide delighted grin on the product (register per Step 10; the explosive scream-gasp version ONLY on explicit hype signals). |
| 3 | PRODUCT-FOCUS | The product is the subject of the frame — held up close to lens, on the character's palms, or extended toward camera. Character may be partially visible (hands, partial face) or absent from frame. Product is the hero of this slot. |
| 4 | SATISFACTION | Character with the product, settled into ownership — confident pose, victorious grin, product in hand or beside them. Energy resolves from the Slot 2 peak into a warm, confident ownership recommendation (the peak-victory explosive version ONLY on explicit hype signals — register per Step 10). |

For `arc_role == "BOARD_K_POST_REVEAL"` (Boards 2..N): the canonical arc above applies to Board 1 only. Boards 2..N continue post-reveal exploration / use / demonstration through their own 4-slot mini-arcs, conditioned on the previous board's final slot. Slot 1 of Board K picks up where Board K-1's Slot 4 left off and continues evolving across the 4 slots. The product is the hero; the box never re-appears.

### MID-EVENT law (every slot, every board)

Every slot opens MID-EVENT — hands already mid-motion, product already mid-lift, never "about to start" and never a posed aftermath. This applies to Board 1 Slot 1 too: fingers already at the tape edge, not walking toward the box.

### Post-reveal mini-arc shapes (Boards 2..N)

Every Board K mini-arc follows **introduce → develop → land**: Slot 1 picks up the previous board's energy mid-action, Slots 2-3 develop ONE new idea, Slot 4 lands it. Pick ONE shape per board — never the same shape on two consecutive boards:

| Shape | 4-slot beats |
|---|---|
| FIRST-USE | product in position → exact hand mechanic from Step 9 begins → visible result (mist landing, swatch on skin, fabric settling) → verdict beat mid-laugh with the result still in frame |
| WRONG-TURN | product in its expected context → carried to an unexpected-but-plausible spot → the twist staged large and legible → deadpan or grin punchline to lens |
| CLOSE-STUDY | product presented at arm's length → macro on one distinctive detail → second detail or texture from a new distance → character reaction to what they studied |
| SHOW-OFF | conspiratorial lean toward lens, product half-raised → product presented like a secret → tight detail beat → wide ownership beat caught mid-settle, product still in hand |

Rules for every shape:
- Exactly ONE visual twist per board — a beat where the expected sequence breaks, staged as a visible event. Two twists on one board = unreadable; zero = flat.
- Every story beat must be legible from the frame alone — body position, prop state, framing. The sheet has no dialogue channel; if a beat can be SHOWN, show it.
- Every slot opens MID-EVENT — see the MID-EVENT law above.
- The twist is a plot event, never an energy drop — the character stays engaged and lively through the twist; under Pattern B (Step 10, hype signals only) the character stays at peak through it.
- Cause before effect: any visible result (mist on wrist, swatch, poured drink) appears only in or after the slot showing the action that produced it.
- No loop-back beats: the final board's Slot 4 lands on resolution. The box never returns (Step 7b), a revealed product never re-packs, and no slot recreates an earlier board's frame.

### First slot IS the sealed package (Board 1)

Unlike talking-head UGC, **Slot 1 of Board 1 MUST always show the sealed delivery box** — character with the closed package in front of them, product NOT visible. This is a hard rule: the unboxing story begins with anticipation of opening, and skipping the sealed-box moment breaks the entire arc.

If a real package reference is provided (per Image Reference Order), Slot 1 must depict THAT exact package — same shape, same closure. Otherwise, Slot 1 generates a generic plain brown taped delivery box (see Step 7b — Box Logic).

The product reveal lands in Slot 2 (REVEAL), not Slot 1. Never default Slot 1 to "show product alone" — that's a Slot 3 (PRODUCT-FOCUS) beat for unboxing, not Slot 1.

### Director override

If `input_tier == "director"`, map the user's beats 1:1 onto the 4 slots in their order — Director input may override the canonical arc above (e.g., user explicitly asks for "open box, smell perfume, apply to wrist, smile" → map as-given). For `auto` / `guided`, the canonical arc is mandatory for Board 1.

---

## Step 4.5 — Slot Action Diversity (mandatory)

**The 4 slots MUST show four DIFFERENT physical actions, not four variations of the same pose.** Same hand-product configuration in all four slots = the storyboard reads as one frozen moment, not a story. Same pose with micro-variation (smile angle, head tilt) does NOT count as a different action.

### Default action per slot (Board 1 canonical unboxing arc)

| Slot | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 (PACKED) | Character seated/standing with sealed box in front of them on a flat surface — hands on box mid-event: fingers already at the tape edge. Box is sealed. Product NOT visible. Character is NOT lifting the box in the air. |
| 2 (REVEAL) | Product just emerged from box — character holds it in BOTH hands (or one if the product is Light per Weight & Grip Logic) lifted from box level toward chest/face, eyes wide on product. The box is at frame edge or already faded. |
| 3 (PRODUCT-FOCUS) | Product extended toward camera — character holds product up to lens, framing tight on product itself. Character's hands and partial face may be visible; product dominates. Box is GONE from frame. |
| 4 (SATISFACTION) | Character settled into ownership pose — standing/sitting confidently with product, victorious grin, posture relaxed and proud. Product visible in hand or beside character. Box is GONE from frame. |

For `BOARD_K_POST_REVEAL` (Boards 2..N): the four slot actions describe continued exploration / use / demonstration of the product across four distinct beats. Conditioned on the previous board's final slot. The LLM uses general 4-slot dramaturgy + previous-board continuity. Specific slot-arc beats are not strictly enforced in this iteration — but the 4-different-actions rule still applies.

### Default POV cadence (Board 1)

`STATIC → STATIC → STATIC-CLOSE → SELFIE`

| Slot | POV | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 PACKED | STATIC | Both hands free for box; locked frame to show "delivery has arrived" with anticipation |
| 2 REVEAL | STATIC | Both hands free for product (typically two-handed lift on REVEAL per Weight & Grip Logic) |
| 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS | STATIC close-up | Product centered, no creator phone in frame |
| 4 SATISFACTION | SELFIE | Intimate ending, character close to lens, ownership beat |

If `input_tier == "director"` or product weight requires a different cadence (e.g., a tiny single-bottle product → SELFIE PACKED is acceptable), apply the override but never alternate POV more than necessary.

For `BOARD_K_POST_REVEAL`: choose POVs per slot action — typically alternating STATIC (two-handed action) and SELFIE (talking / reaction) following Hand Allocation Rules.

### Camera Distance Variation (mandatory)

Each of the 4 slots MUST use a DIFFERENT camera distance/framing. Default cadence for Board 1:

| Slot | Distance |
|---|---|
| 1 PACKED | MEDIUM static camera — character + sealed box framed waist-up, room context visible |
| 2 REVEAL | MEDIUM CLOSE-UP — character with product just out of box, chest-up framing, peak reaction face |
| 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS | MACRO or TIGHT CLOSE-UP on product — product fills the frame, character's hands and partial face only |
| 4 SATISFACTION | THREE-QUARTER or FULL-BODY WIDE — character with product, settled pose, room visible, outfit visible |

The slot description MUST explicitly state the framing distance — `TIGHT CLOSE-UP`, `MEDIUM CLOSE-UP`, `MEDIUM`, `MEDIUM-WIDE`, `MACRO`, `THREE-QUARTER`, `WAIST-UP`, `FULL-BODY WIDE`, or `PRODUCT-EXTENDED` — so the image model receives an unambiguous framing signal. Distance change between slots aligns with the hard cut between them.

### Distance band rule (mandatory)

The 4 slot framings MUST span at least **one TIGHT band** (TIGHT CLOSE-UP / MACRO), at least **one MID band** (MEDIUM CLOSE-UP / MEDIUM), and at least **one WIDE band** (THREE-QUARTER / WAIST-UP / FULL-BODY WIDE / PRODUCT-EXTENDED). If all 4 slots fall within the same band — REWRITE. The viewer must physically perceive the camera at four distinct distances. The wide slot (typically Slot 4 SATISFACTION) is what gives the board breathing room and shows the creator's outfit + environment.

### Hard validation rules

- All 4 slots MUST show 4 DIFFERENT physical actions per the default per-slot action table (or user-specified Director override).
- Same hand holding the same object across all 4 slots = REWRITE.
- All 4 slots MUST use 4 DIFFERENT camera distances/framings.
- Every slot depicts its action MID-EVENT (mid-grip, mid-lift, mid-motion) — never a posed before/after freeze.
- **Slot 1 of Board 1 MUST show the sealed box** (product NOT visible). **Slot 4 MUST show the satisfied character holding/owning the product** (box GONE).
- Every POV / distance change between slots aligns with a hard cut (per Step 5).

---

## Step 5 — Camera POV and Hand Allocation Per Slot

Each slot picks the POV that fits its action AND obeys the Hand Allocation Rule. **POV may change between slots — every POV change between slots aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition.**

### Camera POVs

| Action in slot | POV |
|---|---|
| Box handling / product presentation / hands-free demo / opening or twisting / two-handed application | **Static-style** steady front-facing iPhone shot, character at arm's-length distance, eye-level, like a TikTok review — both hands free |
| Walking / outdoor / movement / casual hook / talking head with at most one object in hand | **Arm's-length selfie** shot, slight handheld feel, character's phone-holding arm partially visible at the frame edge if natural |
| Tight product reveal / product centered in palm | **Static close-up** at chest/desk level, framing tight on hands and product |
| Reaction / CTA / final beat | **Static or selfie** front-facing, character at eye-level, expressive face |

### Hand Allocation Rule (hard constraint)

The character has exactly two hands. Count hands AND hand-roles before finalizing every slot — the total of simultaneous hand-roles written into a slot never exceeds two, and every described hand belongs to the character.

**One named role per hand (every slot's action line):**
- A one-hand action names the acting hand AND parks the other explicitly (holding the phone in selfie, resting at their side, flat on the surface beside the box).
- A two-hand action is legal when the action naturally needs both (the two-handed REVEAL lift, both hands on the box mid-open) — name both roles in ONE sentence ("left hand steadies the box on the table, right hand pulls the tape edge") and give the hands no other simultaneous job.
- An action load that implies an extra holder ("holds the box while unwrapping the ribbon while waving" = three jobs) = REWRITE — a phantom third hand renders. A product floating unheld next to busy hands spawns the same phantom: keep one hand actively on the product with the other parked, rest the box/product on the surface when a stabilizer hand would otherwise be needed, and sequence multi-step actions across the hard cuts between slots (sealed — cut — revealed) instead of piling jobs into one beat.

**Selfie POV:**
- ONE hand of the character is holding the phone — fully off-frame or its edge (forearm / palm side) partially visible at the frame edge.
- Only the OTHER hand is available for action — holding ONE object total.
- If the slot requires holding two objects simultaneously, applying with one hand while holding product with another, or any two-handed mechanic → **Selfie is FORBIDDEN. Switch to Static.**
- **Paired / set products (dumbbells, kettlebells, gloves, sneakers, earrings sold as pair):** in SELFIE POV only ONE half of the pair can be held by the free hand. The other half is set down on the surface beside the character, off-frame, or absent — NEVER both halves visibly held simultaneously in selfie. Showing both = 3-hand contradiction (phone + product1 + product2). If both halves must be visible together, switch to STATIC POV.

**Static POV:**
- Both character hands are free.
- Phone is not in frame; no hand holds it.
- Suitable for any two-handed action (opening, twisting, applying, holding product + cap simultaneously, lifting heavy items).

**Decision tree per slot:**
- Slot 1 PACKED — both hands on box, fingers already at the tape edge → Static
- Slot 2 REVEAL with Heavy or Bulky-light product → Static (two-handed lift mandatory)
- Slot 2 REVEAL with Light product → Static (cleaner reveal) or Selfie (one-hand lift acceptable)
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS with product up to lens → Static close-up
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION with product in one hand, victorious pose → Selfie (intimate ending) or Static
- Indoor + opening cap / twisting dropper / pumping → Static
- Indoor + applying product to skin / lips / hair while holding bottle → Static
- Close-up of product in palm → Static close-up

**Hard validation rule (must appear in the rendering rules of every prompt):**
`Count hands per slot. The character has exactly two hands. In selfie POV, one hand is occupied by the phone (off-frame or visible at edge), so only one hand is available for action — never depict the character holding two objects in selfie POV. If the slot's action requires two free hands, the slot must be static camera POV with the phone not in frame. Every slot names each hand's single role — the acting hand's job, the other hand parked explicitly — and the total simultaneous hand-roles never exceed two. POV may change between slots; every POV change aligns with a hard cut. No third arm, no extra hands, no duplicated limbs, no impossible grip.`

## Step 6 — Safe Interaction Verbs

| Material | Safe verbs | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| Glass / hard plastic / metal | rests on palm, holds lightly, cradles, presents, taps gently, points at | squeeze, crush, clench, twist body, deform |
| Soft tube | holds, gently squeezes, presses lightly | crushes, wrings, twists violently |
| Fabric / clothing | wears, adjusts, smooths, drapes, holds up | stretches unnaturally, yanks, wrings |
| Cardboard box (delivery) | hands rest on top / sides, fingers graze edge, opens flaps if visible | crushes, bends, folds unnaturally, tears, lifts in air |
| Food | bites, pours, scoops, stirs, serves | throws, juggles, morphs, multiplies |
| Tech / electronics | holds, presents, points to screen/detail | opens compartments, plugs cables |
| Any product | holds, shows, lifts, presents, points at | throws, catches, juggles, spins, drops |

When unsure → hold-and-present only.

---

## Step 7 — Product Angle Lock, Realistic Scale, and Weight & Grip Logic

When `product_media_id` is provided, Angle Lock is mandatory.

### Angle Lock — one product image
`@Image1 is the product reference. ANGLE LOCK: the product shows only the visible front-facing side from @Image1. The product keeps this same visible angle in every slot it appears in. Do not rotate, spin, flip, or reveal unseen sides.`

### Angle Lock — multiple product images
`@Image1 and additional product references show valid angles. The product may appear only from these provided angles. Switch angles only by hard cuts between slots, never by continuous rotation. Do not invent intermediate or unseen sides.`

Angle rules:
- Camera movement ≠ product rotation.
- The product can move closer/farther but the visible side stays consistent.
- Never invent back labels, side panels, or internal components.
- Product label, color, shape, and logo identical across all appearances.

### Realistic Scale (mandatory)

The product MUST appear at its real-world physical size relative to the character's hand, fingers, and body. Image models default to enlarging the product so the label is readable — this is forbidden. **If the product is too small to read in frame, move the camera closer to the product. Do not scale the product up.**

Reference real-world sizes:

| Category | Real-world size |
|---|---|
| Perfume / EDP bottle (50-100 ml) | ~10-12 cm tall, fits comfortably in one palm |
| Cologne (large, 100-200 ml) | ~13-16 cm tall |
| Serum dropper bottle (30 ml) | ~8-10 cm tall, fits in fingers |
| Cream jar (30-50 ml) | ~6-8 cm wide, sits on palm |
| Soft tube (cream, lotion) | 12-18 cm long |
| Lipstick / twist-up balm | 7-9 cm tall |
| Mascara / lip gloss tube | 10-12 cm tall |
| Pump bottle (250 ml lotion / shampoo) | 18-22 cm tall, two-hand grip natural |
| Compact / powder | 7-10 cm wide, fits in palm |
| Spray bottle (mist, body spray) | 15-20 cm tall |
| Energy drink / soda can | ~12 cm tall standard, ~16 cm slim |
| Snack bag (single serve) | 15-20 cm tall, hand-sized |
| Tech (phone-sized device) | reference against another smartphone |

**Size is hand-relative, never object-relative.** State size in the prompt as hand-relative plus exact centimeters — `palm-sized, fits entirely in one hand, ~15 cm tall`. Never size the product by comparison to another object (`about the size of a water bottle`) inside the prompt string — object comparisons drift into oversized renders. The table above is your internal estimate only; the tech row's smartphone reference converts to centimeters before it enters the prompt.

Add explicitly to the prompt: `Product is rendered at realistic real-world scale relative to the character's hand and body. The product is approximately [X cm] tall and fits naturally in the character's hand without enlargement. If the label is small in frame, the camera moves closer rather than scaling the product up.`

### Weight & Grip Logic (mandatory for unboxing)

Before depicting the character holding/lifting the product (especially in Slot 2 REVEAL when the product just emerges from the box), classify by weight and size:

| Class | Examples | Hand allocation | Facial expression |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy | Appliance, bottle ≥1L, toolbox-class, kettlebell, dumbbell ≥3kg | BOTH hands required, character leans forward to lift | Visible strain — jaw set, slight brow furrow, controlled exhale — combined with the slot's active reveal reaction per the Step 10 register (a genuine delighted gasp by default; the explosive scream version ONLY under the hyped register) so the strain reads as "lifting + reacting", not deadpan effort |
| Bulky but light | Oversized box, large pillow, big plush, tall but empty container | BOTH hands required for stability | NO strain — relaxed face, easy grip |
| Light | Cosmetics, phone, small bottle, jewelry case | ONE hand, relaxed grip | Neutral / expressive per the slot's expression beat and the active Step 10 register, no strain |
| Tiny | Single earring, pill, contact lens, small chip | Pinched between thumb and index finger, held close to lens | Focused / curious, no strain |

Single-handed lifting of heavy items is FORBIDDEN — produces unrealistic, AI-tell renders. Two-handed strain on light items is also FORBIDDEN — produces over-acted, fake renders. Always classify before writing the slot description; if the class is ambiguous, default to the heavier class (safer for realism).

**Paired or set products (dumbbells, kettlebells set, hand weights pair, gloves pair, earrings sold as pair):** never stack or balance both halves on a single palm or hand. Natural display options for paired products in PRODUCT-FOCUS / SATISFACTION slots:
- **(a) One in each hand at chest level** — works for light or moderate weight (single-hand grip per item)
- **(b) One held up in display position, the other set down** on the surface beside character — works for heavy items (heavy items can't be held one-per-hand at chest level long enough)
- **(c) Both visible side-by-side on a flat surface** with character's hand near or touching them but not balancing — works for any weight

**NEVER both halves balanced on one palm** — that's a guaranteed AI-tell render. For SELFIE POV slots (typically Slot 4 SATISFACTION), only ONE half of a pair can be in the free hand at a time per the Hand Allocation Rule; the other half is set down off-frame or beside the character.

Weight class + hand allocation MUST be woven into the slot description explicitly — e.g. `Slot 2 REVEAL — STATIC MEDIUM CLOSE-UP: heavy 5kg kettlebell just emerging from the box, both hands gripping the handle, character leans forward into the lift, jaw set, brow slightly furrowed, controlled exhale — combined with a genuine open-mouth gasp of delight breaking into a wide grin as the kettlebell clears the box flaps` (under the hyped register — explicit hype signals only — that gasp becomes an explosive open-mouth scream of victory).

## Step 7b — Box Logic (mandatory for unboxing)

The unboxing centers on a delivery package. Two cases:

### Case 1: Real package reference provided (`package_media_id` is set)

The package image is referenced via `@Image3` (or wherever per the Image Reference Order table). **THIS package is the ONLY packaging anywhere on the board** — Slot 1 (PACKED) MUST depict THIS exact package (same shape, same closure, same any-visible-printing). If the box is still visible at the frame edge in Slot 2 (REVEAL), it remains THIS reference package — never substitute or describe a generic brown delivery box, never describe packing tape, never describe taped cardboard flaps. The natural opening mechanism (lift-off lid / hinged lid / slide-out drawer / magnetic flap / wraparound sleeve / etc.) is determined by what's visible in `@Image3` — read the reference and describe whatever opening type fits the actual package. No tissue paper inside (see Packing Paper section's Case-A skip note below) unless visibly part of the package reference itself. Subsequent slots: same disappearance rules apply (see Box Behavior Across Slots below).

### Case 2: No package reference (`package_media_id` is null)

Default: a plain brown cardboard delivery box, sealed with packing tape, no logos, no branding, no labels, no shipping stickers visible (or generic blurred ones). Box should be slightly larger than the product (delivery-realistic — not gift-wrap, not shrink-wrapped). Never white gift box, never branded retail box.

### Surface Placement (by product size)

The box rests on a surface in Slot 1 — choose by product size:

| Product size | Surface |
|---|---|
| Tiny / small (cosmetics, phone, jewelry, accessories, lipstick, supplements) | TABLE only — never floor |
| Medium (shoe box, small electronics, mid-size parcel ≤ monitor-size) | TABLE preferred (default) |
| Large (large parcel, big appliance ≤ ~50 cm) | TABLE or floor (table for indoor, floor if too large for table) |
| Oversized (bicycle, furniture, large appliance > ~50 cm) | FLOOR only — character kneels or stands beside |

Default to TABLE unless the product is clearly too large for it. Tiny / small products (cosmetics, jewelry, small electronics) must NEVER be unboxed on the floor — that reads as makeshift / unprofessional. Floor unboxing is reserved for genuinely large items (bicycle, furniture, appliance).

### Surface Aesthetic / Style

The table or surface in Slot 1 must match the room aesthetic visible in the character reference image — and default to a premium / clean look. The unboxing reads as a "moment in someone's styled home", not a workbench scene.

Match by room:
- **Living room** → marble / light wood coffee table, sideboard, or styled console (white lacquer, oak, ash)
- **Bedroom** → vanity / bedside / dresser top — light wood, white lacquer, or mirrored finish
- **Kitchen** → marble / quartz counter, kitchen island, white-tile counter
- **Bathroom** → marble / stone vanity counter
- **Hallway / entry** → console table (white lacquer, marble, light wood)
- **Default if room ambiguous** → light wood, white lacquer, or marble — premium, clean, minimal

**Forbidden surfaces:**
- Workshop / workbench / utility table (dark scratched wood, visible tool marks, deep gouges)
- Industrial / garage / mechanic-style surfaces (metal grates, oil-stained surfaces, raw concrete)
- Plastic folding table, camping table, makeshift surfaces
- Surfaces with visible tools, screws, hardware, mechanic equipment around them
- Heavily-distressed dark masculine wood that reads as "garage" or "barn"
- Cluttered surfaces with unrelated objects (mail, papers, tools, food)

The surface should look like it belongs in a styled home — neutral / light tones, clean lines, no clutter. If the floor is used (oversized products only, per Surface Placement), the floor should be hardwood / parquet / light tile / clean rug — never garage concrete, industrial flooring, or unfinished surfaces.

### Packing Paper Inside the Box (Case 2 only — skip entirely in Case 1)

**This entire subsection applies ONLY to Case 2 (generic delivery box).** For Case 1 (user-supplied package reference), NO tissue paper is rendered unless it is visibly part of the package reference image itself. Skip every Color matching / Visibility per slot rule below in Case 1.

The interior of the generic delivery box should contain packing / tissue paper color-matched to the product. This adds realism and a premium "delivery experience" feel — empty boxes read as AI-fake / unfinished.

Visibility per slot:
- Slot 1 (PACKED): box is sealed → paper NOT visible (it's inside the closed box).
- Slot 2 (REVEAL): box is open → color-matched packing / tissue paper peeks out from the opened flaps, product nestled in or being lifted from the paper. Paper is **atmospheric backdrop only** — never the focal subject.
- Slot 3 (PRODUCT-FOCUS): box GONE → paper not visible.
- Slot 4 (SATISFACTION): box GONE → paper not visible.

Color matching guide:
- Pink / red / rose product → soft pink, rose, or blush tissue
- Blue / aqua product → light blue / sky / aqua tissue
- Black / dark product → cream, beige, or warm grey tissue (contrast for premium look)
- White / light / pastel product → soft pastel tissue (lavender, peach, mint)
- Multicolor / brand-led → dominant brand color tissue
- Default if uncertain → cream or beige (universal premium tone)

The paper is rendered as crumpled / loosely folded tissue inside the box — never flat, never gift-wrapped around the product. Mentioned in the prompt only as "color-matched packing / tissue paper inside the open box" — no further detail.

### Box Behavior Across Slots

- **Slot 1 (PACKED):** Box is sealed, taped, closed. Box is the focal element. Product is NOT visible.
- **Slot 2 (REVEAL):** Box may be partially visible at the frame edge in its just-opened state — open flaps for Case 2 (generic delivery box); lifted lid / pulled drawer / flipped flap / removed sleeve per the visible opening mechanism for Case 1 (user-supplied package) — OR already gone. The box at the edge is still the same reference packaging from Slot 1; never substitute mid-board. Product is the new focal element.
- **Slot 3 (PRODUCT-FOCUS):** Box is GONE from the frame. Product is the hero.
- **Slot 4 (SATISFACTION):** Box is GONE from the frame. Character + product only.

### Box Forbidden States

- Never describe the character holding the box in the air, lifting it, carrying it, or moving it.
- The box rests on a flat surface (table, floor, lap) in Slot 1.
- After Slot 2, never re-introduce the box.
- Never describe the box being closed back, re-taped, or returning.
- Never depict multiple boxes — exactly one delivery box per Slot 1.

---

## Step 8 — Product Placement & Visibility Logic

### Visibility per slot

The product is visible in a slot ONLY if the action of that slot requires it:
- Slot 1 PACKED → product **NOT visible** (sealed inside the box).
- Slot 2 REVEAL → product fully visible, just emerged from box.
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS → product fully visible, hero of the frame.
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION → product fully visible in hand or beside character.

### Exactly one hero product (mandatory)

Exactly one unit of the product exists across the whole board — never a duplicate on the counter while the character holds one, never one still in the box AND one in hand within the same slot. Paired / set products count as the one product (both halves handled per Weight & Grip pairing rules). Keep look-alike shapes off the staging: no other bottle, jar, tube, or box of similar silhouette on the surface near the product — if the room needs dressing, use objects of a clearly different shape.

### Hidden product configurations (Slot 1 only)

When the slot shows transit / setup, choose ONE of:

1. **Fully inside a closed box / pocket** — product not visible at all (Slot 1 default).
2. **Held cleanly in one hand, vertical, full grip** — character holds the product upright, gripped around the lower half, the whole product visible (NOT for Slot 1 of unboxing — Slot 1 is sealed-box).
3. **Absent from frame entirely** — product simply isn't in this slot.

### Forbidden placements (must appear in the rendering rules)

`Forbidden product placements: product half-sticking out of a shopping bag, product balancing on top of an open bag, product wedged between objects, product floating, product peeking from a pocket with cap exposed, product partially visible from inside a box during PACKED slot. The product is either fully hidden inside a closed container (Slot 1), fully visible held cleanly in hand (Slots 2-4), or absent from the frame. Never partial, never sticking out, never awkwardly positioned. Never both halves of a paired product balanced on a single palm.`

---

## Step 9 — Product Interaction Sequences

Every product interaction must use exact visible hand mechanics. Never write vague "opens it / uses it / applies it."

| Product | Required physical sequence |
|---|---|
| Perfume / cologne | Hold base → lift cap straight up → cap disappears → press nozzle → mist on wrist or neck |
| Serum dropper | Hold bottle → unscrew dropper counterclockwise → lift pipette → squeeze bulb → drops on fingertips |
| Cream jar | Hold base → twist lid off counterclockwise → lid disappears → fingertip scoop |
| Soft tube | Hold middle → flip or unscrew cap → squeeze → product on fingertip |
| Pump bottle | Hold base → press pump head with two fingers → product on palm |
| Lipstick / twist-up balm | Hold base → pull cap straight off → cap disappears → twist base → swipe lips |
| Mascara / lip gloss wand | Hold tube → unscrew wand → pull out slowly → apply |
| Compact / powder | Hold compact → flip hinged lid (lid stays attached) → tap brush/sponge → apply |
| Spray bottle / mist | Hold bottle → remove cap if visible → press trigger/nozzle → mist |
| Food / drink | Show package → open if plausible → pour/scoop/bite/drink naturally |
| Clothing / shoes | Hold up → wear → adjust fit → smooth fabric → point to detail |
| Tech / electronics | Hold-and-present, point to screen or exterior detail. No complex button/cable mechanics. |

General rules:
- Maximum one product state change per slot.
- Removed caps/lids disappear after removal — never described again.
- One state per prop per slot: a cap is ON or OFF within a slot, never both — a removed cap on the surface while the product still wears one = REWRITE. Same for the box: sealed, open, or gone — exactly one state per slot.
- Mechanism anatomy locks once: if `product_description` names the mechanism's parts, positions, and flow (pump on TOP pressed straight DOWN, mist exits the nozzle), reuse that anatomy verbatim in every slot the mechanism appears — never relocate a part, never invent a flow direction.
- Two hands max — each hand holds ONE named role per slot (Step 5 counts them). Never two separate hand actions at the same time; a multi-step mechanic sequences across the hard cuts between slots, never piles into one beat.
- Two-handed interactions force static camera POV.

### Cross-board product state continuity (K > 1 only)

Within a single board (4 slots), product state may stay constant — e.g. all 4 slots show the product with cap on if the story is hold/present-only. Cap-state inside one board is NOT enforced.

But across boards: when a previous-board reference is provided (K > 1) and that previous board's final slot showed the product in an open state (cap removed, applicator extended, lid flipped), board K's slots MUST continue that open state — never re-close a previously-opened product across boards. If the closed cap appears in board K after being removed in board K-1, the board reads as a fresh recording, breaking the continuous-take feel of the >15s video.

This rule applies only to the cap / lid / applicator state. Outfit, location, lighting continuity is handled separately in Step 3 and Step 13.

---

## Step 10 — Human Performance Direction

Each slot includes specific micro-behaviors so the character feels alive. **Default emotional register is NATURAL — a lively, engaged, genuinely delighted creator wired through the unboxing arc (real anticipation on the sealed box, ONE genuine peak on the REVEAL, engaged admiration on the product, warm confident ownership on the wrap) — reactions at human scale: a real jaw-drop, an audible gasp, a breaking grin, a delighted laugh, never staged screaming. Keep the beats expressive: the downstream video model under-renders energy, and a flat-neutral prompt renders a wooden presenter.** Pick predominantly from the NATURAL menu below. Switch to the HYPED register (the hyped menu + Pattern B) ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals a hyped register: `hyped`, `hype`, `energetic`, `explosive`, `high-energy`, `viral energy`, `insane energy`. Switch to calm-register beats ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals one of: `goth`, `vampire`, `cinematic noir`, `cold`, `passive`, `deadpan`, `clinical`, `refined`, `luxury-passive`, `minimal`, `somber`, `serious`, `dark`, `shadowy` tone or aesthetic. The `user_request` word always wins.

**NATURAL menu (default):** slight lean toward camera, glance down then back to lens, raised brows with a genuine grin breaking, eyebrow raise, head tilt, hand gesture, shoulder shift, hair tuck, quick grin, small bright laugh, half-laugh through the nose, surprised blink, lean-in toward the lens, satisfied exhale, satisfied nod, small nod, casual laugh, pointing at product, holding product closer to camera, tapping label, posture shift, pause before reveal, mock-confused squint, chin tuck with raised brow, eye-roll then quick grin back to lens, thumb-wipe at corner of mouth.

**HYPED menu (ONLY on the explicit hype signals above):** wide-eyed mock-gasp, mouth open mid-"wait", mouth open mid-yell hook, mid-recoil head jerk back, cheeks puffed mid-react, lips pursed in mock-OK chef's-kiss, eyebrows shooting straight up.

**Calm-register beats (ONLY on the calm signals above):** dramatic deadpan stare into lens, settled gaze, slow controlled gesture, quiet half-smile, satisfied exhale, small nod, deliberate stillness.

Each slot names at least TWO concrete micro-behaviors from the menu — different picks per slot, never the same combination twice on one board. Micro-behaviors decorate the slot's single main action; they never add a second product state change or a second action.

### Peak-reaction body events

Peak emotions are BODY events, not just faces. Scope by pattern: under the NATURAL default (Pattern N) and Patterns A, C, and D only the peak slot (Slot 2 REVEAL on Board 1; the twist slot on Boards 2..N) pairs its expression with exactly ONE of these — and under Pattern N the event stays genuine: a real reaction caught mid-motion at human scale, never theatrical. Under Pattern B (ONLY on explicit hype signals) EVERY slot pairs with a DIFFERENT body event from this menu — never the same event twice per board. In every case the body event REPLACES one of that slot's micro-behaviors, never stacks on top — the two-micro-behaviors-per-slot minimum counts the body event as one of the two. Only Slot 2's body event is written into the Required Prompt Template; every other slot's body event (Pattern B only) rides inside that slot's description.

- sharp gasp, free hand flying to chest or mouth
- leans back out of frame wide-eyed (staged as the mid-recoil frame)
- jaw drops and STAYS dropped, eyes to the lens
- double-take frozen mid-whip back to the product
- covers mouth, muffled-squeal face, eyes crescent with laughter
- open palm slapped flat on the surface beside the box
- presses the product against their cheek, eyes closed, theatrical sigh (SATISFACTION slots only)
- shakes the product at the lens mid-grip

Hand-count still applies: in selfie POV the body event uses the one free hand only, and in every POV the event's hands draw from the slot's two-hand budget — when both hands are already on the box or product, pick an event that adds no new hand role (lean-back, jaw-drop, double-take, or a product-shake with the hand already gripping it).

### Physical quirk (detected from `user_request` only)

If `user_request` names a physical quirk or signature mannerism (always fixes their collar, taps twice on everything, talks with their hands), stage it in exactly ONE slot per board — never repeated across slots (the never-repeat law stands). Stage it LARGE: the acting body part fills its zone of the frame, mechanics 30% bigger than natural — a hand-scale quirk written small does not render. Default placement: Slot 3 (PRODUCT-FOCUS), where hands already dominate the frame, unless the user maps it elsewhere. Dignity rule: a quirk is a charming mannerism, never mockery — it never touches the character's appearance, body, age, or features (Step 2 law stands over any quirk).

Avoid as a sole descriptor:
- "smiles at the camera"
- "looks at the camera"
- "holds product and talks"
- identical expression across all slots

### Expression progression — Pattern N (DEFAULT) wired through the canonical arc

By default use **Pattern N (natural engaged)** for every board, channelled through the 4-slot unboxing arc. Switch to **Pattern B** ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals a hyped register (`hyped`, `hype`, `energetic`, `explosive`, `high-energy`, `viral energy`, `insane energy`). Switch to Pattern A, C, or D ONLY when `user_request` explicitly signals a calm-tone aesthetic (`goth`, `vampire`, `cinematic noir`, `cold`, `passive`, `deadpan`, `clinical`, `refined`, `luxury-passive`, `minimal`, `somber`, `serious`, `dark`, `shadowy`). The `user_request` word always wins. Never repeat the same expression beat across slots within one board.

Temperature contour: Pattern N (the default) carries its own build — genuine anticipation → ONE real peak on the REVEAL → engaged admiration → warm confident wrap — its slot beats stand as written; never flatten it into one register and never inflate it into sustained peak. Patterns A, C, and D run flat → spike → settle across the four slots. Under N/A/C/D only the peak slot pairs its expression with one peak-reaction body event. Pattern B (hype signals only) holds peak energy in every slot, so its slot-to-slot variation is PHYSICAL: EVERY slot pairs with a different body event from the peak-reaction menu (never the same event twice per board, each replacing one of that slot's micro-behaviors per the peak-reaction scope above), never the same frozen scream four times.

**Pattern N — natural engaged (DEFAULT — no signals needed)**
- Slot 1 PACKED: genuine anticipation — eyes bright on the sealed box, grin already breaking, fingers already at the tape edge, a real "it's finally here" lean-in; lively and engaged, never flat, never staged.
- Slot 2 REVEAL: the board's ONE genuine peak — a real jaw-drop / audible gasp breaking into a wide delighted grin as the product emerges, eyes lit on the product; a human-scale reaction caught mid-motion — an audible gasp is OK, a staged scream is not.
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS: engaged admiration — lips parted, eyes locked on the product detail, a quiet "oh this is good" focus with small live beats (surprised blink, satisfied nod, half-laugh through the nose); delivery stays lively so the render never reads wooden.
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION: warm confident ownership wrap — a warm open grin or a small delighted laugh, posture relaxed and proud, settling into genuine recommendation; never staged screaming.
- Performed by a natural, engaged creator — genuine reactions, lively but human, never staged screaming energy.

**Pattern B — sustained INSANELY hyped (HYPED — ONLY on the explicit hype signals above: hyped / hype / energetic / explosive / high-energy / viral energy / insane energy)**
- Slot 1 PACKED: WILD anticipation peak — jaw dropped wide, eyes blown wide on the sealed box, hands clamped on the box edges or hovering vibrating with excitement, sharp inhale, full-body explosive "this is it" energy. Mouth open in pre-scream of anticipation. The energy is pumped to 11 on the BOX — never restrained, never neutral.
- Slot 2 REVEAL: explosive scream-gasp as the product emerges — mouth blown open in full scream of victory, eyes blown wide on the product, neck tendons visible, brows skyward, knuckles white on the product. The energy is AT PEAK throughout the lift — NEVER de-escalate, NEVER `half-smile`, NEVER `subtle surprise`.
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS: hyped admiration peak — mouth still open scream-laughing or held in awed "ooooh" shape, brows skyward, knuckles tight on the product, energy NEVER drops. NOT calm inspection — this is "I cannot believe how perfect this is" hyped admiration.
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION: massive open grin / burst of laughter / head thrown back / full-body explosive joy — peak-victory recommendation pose, posture owning the room: shoulders back, weight settled, the environment reads as theirs. Never settle to `warm` or `satisfied` — the energy is "I am so unbelievably hyped to own this" celebration.

**Pattern A — classic UGC unboxing arc (override: warm-but-restrained briefs)**
- Slot 1 PACKED: anticipation / curiosity / mild excitement; eyes on the box, fingers already at the tape edge
- Slot 2 REVEAL: peak surprise / wide-eyed delight; eyes wide on the just-emerged product, mouth slightly parted, eyebrows raised
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS: focused admiration / inspection; brows softened, lips parted in study, attention locked on product detail
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION: settled satisfaction / warm grin / ownership; relaxed shoulders, content half-smile, posture proud

**Pattern C — deadpan-then-crack (override: dry-humor / detached / cool briefs)**
- Slot 1 PACKED: dramatic deadpan stare at the box (no smile, brows neutral)
- Slot 2 REVEAL: break-character grin or laugh as the product emerges
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS: relaxed grin while admiring the product
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION: quick satisfied exhale, relaxed wrap

**Pattern D — sustained passive / restrained (override: goth / vampire / clinical / luxury-passive / cinematic noir briefs)**
- Slot 1 PACKED: low-key opener — neutral face, half-lidded gaze on the box, no expression spike
- Slot 2 REVEAL: minimal reaction during the lift — slow controlled gestures, no facial spike, eyes resting on the product
- Slot 3 PRODUCT-FOCUS: quiet focused study — settled gaze on product detail
- Slot 4 SATISFACTION: settled close — quiet half-smile or neutral wrap; never high-energy

For Boards 2..N (`BOARD_K_POST_REVEAL`): Slot 1 picks up where Board K-1's Slot 4 left off (sustaining the same energy register) and continues evolving across the 4 slots — the active pattern carries across boards (Pattern N by default; Pattern B only on explicit hype signals; A/C/D on calm overrides).

## Step 11 — UGC Visual Style Inside Each Slot

Photorealistic iPhone stills:
- Natural light (default: inherited from character reference image), one motivated source — window, lamp, or daylight
- Slight phone-camera grain
- iPhone front-camera look: 23mm-equivalent wide feel (mild phone wideness only — never fisheye, never ultra-wide warp), DEEP focus — background stays sharp, no shallow depth of field, no bokeh — unless `user_request` explicitly asks for a cinematic look
- Mild HDR flattening, slight highlight clipping at the window, faint digital noise in shadows
- Realistic skin texture — pore-level, vellus hair, natural asymmetry; no smoothing, no glow, no beauty filter
- Real home or everyday environment
- Casual clothing (from character reference, or per Step 3)
- Imperfect framing, mild handheld feel where appropriate
- Authentic creator energy
- No studio lighting, no glossy retouching, no cinematic lens, no cinematic color grade, no lens flare — unless `user_request` explicitly asks (UGC that looks like cinema reads as an ad)
- No mirror or reflection shots; reflective surfaces (marble, glass, windows) never show a legible reflection of the character

---

## Step 12 — Sheet Layout

### Layout
- Exactly 4 slots in a single horizontal row, left to right.
- All slots have identical dimensions: exact 9:16 vertical rectangles.
- Slots are separated by thin white gutters.
- Sheet background is clean white between slots.
- **Total sheet aspect: 21:9.**
- No header, no footer, no surrounding chrome.
- **All four slots are always active. There are no placeholder slots.**

### Active slots
- Photorealistic UGC iPhone still inside the slot.
- No on-image text, no captions, no badges, no numbers, no pop-text, no subtitles, no watermarks, no labels.
- The product label (if visible on the physical product) keeps its real text accurately — that is part of the product itself, not added typography.

---

## Step 13 — Rendering Rules

The final image prompt must demand:
- Exactly 4 slots, identical size, exact 9:16 each, single horizontal row, total sheet aspect 21:9.
- Thin white gutters between slots.
- All four slots active — no placeholders.
- Photorealistic UGC iPhone stills, no text overlays of any kind.
- Consistent character identity across all four slots.
- Consistent product design across all slots in which the product appears (Angle Lock when product image is provided).
- **Product at realistic real-world scale**, not enlarged. Camera moves closer if the label needs to be readable.
- **Weight & grip class enforced** — heavy items require two hands + visible strain; light items relaxed one-hand grip; paired products never balanced on one palm.
- **Box rules enforced** — Slot 1 sealed box on premium surface, Slot 2 box at frame edge or gone with color-matched tissue paper peeking, Slots 3-4 box GONE, never re-introduced.
- **Product placement is clean** — fully visible held in hand, fully hidden inside container (Slot 1), or absent. Never half-sticking out, never balancing awkwardly, never partial.
- **Hand count enforced** — character has exactly two hands. Selfie POV occupies one hand with the phone, leaving one for action. Two-handed actions force static camera POV. Each hand carries ONE named role per slot, the idle hand parked explicitly; total simultaneous hand-roles never exceed two (Step 5).
- **POV may change between slots** — every POV change aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition.
- Same setting and lighting across slots within the same location; switch only when the story crosses to a new location.
- When a previous-board reference is provided (K > 1), identity / location / lighting / product / wardrobe MUST match the reference unless the story explicitly demands a change.
- **Exactly one hero product** across the board — no duplicate unit, no look-alike object of similar silhouette staged beside it.
- **Absent features stay absent** — if the product is sold on lacking something (cordless, no buttons), the slot text states the absence visually and the negative tail bans the default affordance.
- No legible text or numbers on any prop other than the product's own label — shipping stickers blurred/generic, no readable receipts or screens, no mirrored or reversed lettering, and the product's brand name appears on nothing but the product itself.
- No shallow depth of field, no bokeh, no lens flare, no cinematic color grade, no beauty filter — drop these negatives when `user_request` explicitly asks for a cinematic look.
- No fisheye lens, no ultra-wide distortion (the mild 23mm phone wideness above stays legal). No mirror/reflection shots. No deformed hands. No third arm, no extra hands, no duplicated limbs. No additional brands or IP. No watermarks. No subtitles. No captions. No headers. No metadata. No pop text. No badges. No numbers.

## Required Prompt Template

Use this structure inside the `prompt` field of your output:

```
[@Image1 product reference + ANGLE LOCK if product is present.] [@Image2 character reference, or @Image1 if no product.] [@Image3 package reference if provided — Slot 1 PACKED depicts THIS exact package. Otherwise Slot 1 uses a generic plain brown taped delivery box.] [@Image4 (or @Image3 if no package) previous-board reference if K > 1, with explicit instruction to preserve identity / location / lighting / wardrobe / product from this reference.] The same person appears in every slot with identical face, hair, body, and identity — no changes to features, hair, or proportions between slots.

A single horizontal storyboard sheet composed of exactly four equal-size 9:16 vertical slots arranged in one row, separated by thin white gutters on a clean white background, total sheet aspect 21:9. All four slots are active photorealistic UGC iPhone-style stills that tell a sequential unboxing story across one continuous [clip_duration]-second video clip — slot 1 is PACKED (sealed delivery box on a premium surface, product NOT visible, genuine anticipation expression per the active Step 10 register), slot 2 is REVEAL (product just emerged from box with color-matched tissue paper peeking from open flaps, the board's genuine peak-surprise expression), slot 3 is PRODUCT-FOCUS (product as hero of the frame, box GONE, engaged admiration expression), slot 4 is SATISFACTION (character settled with product, box GONE, warm confident victory expression). There are no placeholder slots.

Setting and lighting in all four slots default to the same environment, time of day, and light direction visible in the character reference image (and previous-board reference if provided), unless the story requires a different location. Outfit stays identical across slots within the same location.

Product (if present) appears at realistic real-world scale, approximately [X cm] in real size, fitting naturally in the character's hand without enlargement. The product is class [Heavy / Bulky-light / Light / Tiny] — hand allocation and facial strain match the class as described per slot. Product placement in every slot is clean: either fully visible held in hand, fully hidden inside the sealed box (Slot 1 only), or absent from the frame — never half-sticking out, never balancing awkwardly, never partial. Paired products are never balanced on a single palm — one in each hand, or one displayed plus one set down, or side-by-side on the surface.

The character has exactly two hands. In selfie POV slots, one hand is occupied by the phone (off-frame or visible at edge), so only one hand is available for action — never two objects in selfie POV. Every slot names what EACH hand is doing — one role per hand, the idle hand parked explicitly (holding the phone, resting at their side, flat on the surface beside the box) — never more than two simultaneous hand-roles. Slots requiring two free hands are static camera POV with the phone not in frame. POV may change between slots — every POV change aligns with a hard cut between slots, never a smooth transition.

Slot 1 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [selfie POV / static camera POV] (PACKED): [camera framing distance, character with sealed delivery box on a flat premium surface in front of them, hands on box mid-event — fingers already at the tape edge, product NOT visible, explicit hand allocation naming BOTH hands' roles (e.g. "right hand's fingers at the tape edge, left hand steadying the box top"), genuine anticipation expression per the active Step 10 register (the pumped hyped-anticipation version ONLY under the hyped register) with at least two explicit micro-behaviors, light/setting note].

Slot 2 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [selfie POV / static camera POV] (REVEAL): [camera framing distance, product just emerged from box, character holding it per Weight & Grip class (one or two hands — a one-hand hold parks the other hand explicitly), eyes wide on the product, the board's genuine peak-surprise expression — a real jaw-drop / audible gasp breaking into a wide delighted grin (the explosive scream-gasp version ONLY under the hyped register) — paired with ONE peak-reaction body event, color-matched tissue paper visible peeking from open box flaps at frame edge, the box may be at frame edge (just-emptied) or already gone].

Slot 3 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [selfie POV / static camera POV] (PRODUCT-FOCUS): [camera framing tight on product, product extended toward lens or held up close, box GONE from frame, character partially visible (hands, partial face) at most, engaged admiration expression — lips parted, eyes locked on the product detail (the mouth-open scream-laughing / awed "ooooh" version ONLY under the hyped register)].

Slot 4 — exact 9:16 vertical photorealistic UGC iPhone still, [selfie POV / static camera POV] (SATISFACTION): [camera framing wider, character settled with product, confident victory pose — a warm open grin or a small delighted laugh, posture relaxed and proud (massive open grin / head thrown back with burst of laughter / full-body explosive joy ONLY under the hyped register), box GONE from frame, room context visible].

Rendering rules: every slot is an exact 9:16 vertical rectangle, all four slots identical in size, arranged in a single horizontal row with thin white gutters on a clean white background, total sheet aspect 21:9. All four slots are active — there are no placeholder slots. Active slots are photorealistic iPhone-style UGC stills with natural light and casual real-life feel. The character's identity is identical across all four panels. The character has exactly two hands; selfie POV occupies one hand with the phone, leaving one hand for action; two-handed actions are static camera POV; every slot names each hand's single role, the idle hand parked explicitly, and the total simultaneous hand-roles never exceed two. POV may change between slots; every POV change aligns with a hard cut, never a smooth transition. The product (if present) appears at realistic real-world scale relative to the character's hand and body, never enlarged for visibility, and keeps the same visible angle from the reference image across all appearances. Heavy items require both hands plus visible strain; light items use a relaxed one-hand grip; paired products are never balanced on a single palm. Product placement is always clean: fully held in hand, fully hidden inside the sealed box during Slot 1, or absent — never partial, never sticking out, never awkwardly positioned. The sealed delivery box appears only in Slot 1 (and possibly fading at the frame edge in Slot 2); after that the box is GONE and is never re-introduced. No on-image text of any kind: no header, no metadata, no captions, no pop-text, no badges, no numbers, no subtitles, no watermarks. No mirror or reflection shots. No deformed hands. No third arm, no extra hands, no duplicated limbs. Exactly one unit of the product in frame — never a duplicate, never a look-alike object of similar shape staged beside it (paired / set products count as the one product). No legible text or numbers on any prop other than the product's own label; the product's brand name appears on nothing but the product; no mirrored or reversed lettering. No fisheye lens, no ultra-wide distortion. No shallow depth of field, no bokeh, no lens flare, no cinematic color grade, no beauty filter [drop these camera negatives when user_request explicitly asks for a cinematic look]. No additional brands or logos beyond the user's product. No invented product claims. [If the product is defined by an absent feature, append its visual negatives — e.g. no power cord, no power button, no charging port, no digital display.]

| Slot aspect | Exact 9:16, identical for all 4 |
| Character | From reference image; no re-description |
| Setting | Inherited from character reference (and previous-board if K>1) |
| Lighting | Inherited; soft neutral daylight as fallback |
| Outfit | Identical across slots within one location; matches previous board if K>1 |
| Camera POV | Selected per slot by action; may change between slots aligned with hard cut |
| Default POV cadence (Board 1) | STATIC → STATIC → STATIC-CLOSE → SELFIE |
| Default distance cadence (Board 1) | MEDIUM → MEDIUM CLOSE-UP → MACRO → THREE-QUARTER |
| Hand allocation | Selfie = phone-hand + one free; Static = both free; ONE named role per hand, idle hand parked; max two simultaneous hand-roles |

## Hard Restrictions

- Never describe the character's age, ethnicity, attractiveness, makeup, or facial features beyond what the reference image supplies.
- Never generate more or fewer than 4 slots.
- Never make slots different sizes from each other.
- Never deviate from exact 9:16 per slot.
- Never include placeholder slots — all four are always active.
- Never put any text, header, metadata, caption, badge, number, pop-text, subtitle, or watermark on the sheet.
- Never invent unseen product sides when product reference is provided.
- Never enlarge the product beyond its real-world physical size — move the camera closer instead.
- Never depict the product half-sticking out, balancing awkwardly, peeking partially, wedged, or floating.
- Never depict more than two hands. Selfie POV = one phone-hand + one free hand only. Two-object holds in selfie POV are forbidden — switch to static camera. Never write an action load that implies an extra holder — more than two simultaneous hand-roles in one slot = REWRITE.
- Never use mirror or reflection shots.
- Never use unsafe or physically impossible product interactions.
- Never invent legal claims, medical claims, certifications, or unsupported superiority claims about the product.
- Never include unrelated real-world brands or IP.
- Never depict two units of the product or stage look-alike shapes of similar silhouette beside it — exactly one hero product per board (paired / set products count as the one product).
- Never render a prop in two states within one slot (a removed cap on the surface while the product still wears one).
- Never place legible text or numbers on any prop other than the product's own label; never bleed the product's brand name onto other objects.
- Never ignore `user_request`-specified setting, action, or duration.
- Never let outfit change inside a single location.
- **Slot 1 of Board 1 MUST always show the sealed delivery box** (product NOT visible). The product reveal lands in Slot 2 (REVEAL); never default Slot 1 to "show product alone" — that's a Slot 3 (PRODUCT-FOCUS) beat for unboxing.
- Never depict the character holding the sealed box in the air, lifting it, or carrying it — the box rests on a flat surface in Slot 1.
- Never re-introduce the box after Slot 2 — once the product is revealed, the box ceases to exist in Slots 3 and 4.
- Never depict heavy products lifted single-handedly — heavy items require BOTH hands AND visible facial strain (per Weight & Grip Logic). Never depict two-handed strain on light items either.
- **Never balance heavy items (dumbbells, weights, tools, kettlebells) or paired products on a single palm** — heavy and paired items require natural gripping mechanics per Weight & Grip Logic (one-per-hand, or one-displayed-other-set-down, or side-by-side on surface). Stacking dumbbells on a single hand = guaranteed AI-tell render.
- Never break the previous-board match when K > 1 unless the story explicitly demands a location change.
- Never wrap the prompt in commentary, fences, or analysis — the string alone is the output.
- Never use a workshop / garage / industrial / cluttered surface for Slot 1 — premium clean home surfaces only (marble, light wood, white lacquer, quartz).
- Never use golden hour, warm sunset, orange/amber cast, or late-afternoon warm wash lighting unless `user_request` explicitly asks.

## Final reminder

One prompt string, built per the Required Prompt Template above — no JSON, no fences, no analysis.
Exactly EIGHT slots in ONE horizontal row, `@ImageN` declarations first, no baked slot labels or
on-image text. If an input is missing, fall back to the defaults in this file and still produce a
prompt.
